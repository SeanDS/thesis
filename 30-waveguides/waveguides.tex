\chapter{Measuring transverse-to-longitudinal phase coupling in waveguide mirrors}
\label{c:waveguides}

As shown in the introduction \note{need link}, waveguide mirrors have been shown to offer a reduction in thermal noise over a dielectric mirror offering equivalent reflectivity, at cryogenic temperatures.

\note{Show plot of aLIGO mirror thermal noise from, and discuss, the Heinert paper.}

\section{Transverse to Longitudinal Phase Coupling}
\note{Pillage the paper for a description of this effect.}

\section{Experiment}
\note{Describe experiment}

\subsection{Suspended Michelson interferometers}
\note{Say why they didn't work.}

\section{Analysis and Results}
\note{Bayesian stuff...}

\section{Outcomes}

The work presented in this chapter shows that waveguide mirrors potentially offer a competitive alternative to dielectric mirrors in future gravitational wave detectors.

\note{Put plot of equivalent angular noise in aLIGO, showing that better suspensions are needed if it were to be used?}
