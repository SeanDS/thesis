  Abstract                 = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.},

  Abstract                 = {Low mechanical loss, high index-of-refraction thin-film coating materials are of particular interest to the gravitational wave detection community, where reduced mirror coating thermal noise in gravitational wave detectors is desirable. Current studies are focused on understanding the loss of amorphous metal oxides such as SiO 2 , Ta 2 O 5 and HfO 2 . Here, we report recent measurements of the temperature dependence of the mechanical loss of ion-beam sputtered hafnium dioxide (HfO 2 ) coatings that have undergone heat treatment. The results indicate that, even when partially crystallized, these coatings have lower loss than amorphous Ta 2 O 5 films below ~100 K and that their loss exhibits some features which are heat-treatment dependent in the temperature range of ~100–200 K, with higher heat treatment yielding lower mechanical loss. The potential for using silica doping of hafnia coatings to prevent crystallization is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {All-reflective optical systems are under consideration for future gravitational wave detector topologies. A key feature of these all-reflective systems is the use of Fabry--Perot cavities with diffraction gratings as input couplers; however, theory predicts and experiment has shown that translation of the grating surface across the incident laser light will introduce additional phase into the system. This translation can be induced through simple side-to-side motion of the coupler, yaw motion of the coupler around a central point (i.e., rotation about a vertical axis), and even via internal resonances (i.e., vibration) of the optical element. In this Letter we demonstrate on a prototype-scale suspended cavity that conventional cavity length-sensing techniques used to detect longitudinal changes along the cavity axis will also be sensitive to translational, rotational, and vibrational motion of the diffractive input coupler. We also experimentally verify the amplitude response and frequency dependency of the noise coupling as given by theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Highly reflective dielectric mirror coatings are critical components in a range of precision optics applications including frequency combs, optical atomic clocks, precision interferometry and ring laser gyroscopes. A key limitation to the performance in these applications is thermal noise, arising from the mechanical loss of the coatings. The origins of the mechanical loss from these coatings is not well understood. Recent work suggests that the mechanical loss of amorphous Ta2O5 coatings can drop by as much as 40% when it is doped with TiO2. We use a combination of electron diffraction data and atomic modelling using molecular dynamics to probe the atomic structure of these coatings, and examine the correlations between changes in the atomic structure and changes in the mechanical loss of these coatings. Our results show the first correlation between changes in the mechanical loss and experimentally measured changes in the atomic structure resulting from variations in the level of TiO2 doping in TiO2-doped Ta2O5 coatings, in that increased homogeneity at the nearest-neighbour level appears to correlate with reduced mechanical loss. It is demonstrated that subtle but measurable changes in the nearest-neighbour homogeneity in an amorphous material can correlate with significant changes in macroscopic properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Higher order Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams have been proposed for use in future gravitational wave detectors, such as upgrades to the Advanced LIGO detectors and the Einstein Telescope, for their potential to reduce the effects of the thermal noise of the test masses. This paper details the theoretical analysis and simulation work carried out to investigate the behavior of LG beams in realistic optical setups, in particular, the coupling between different LG modes in a linear cavity. We present a new analytical approximation to compute the coupling between modes, using Zernike polynomials to describe mirror surface distortions. We apply this method in a study of the behavior of the LG33 mode within realistic arm cavities, using measured mirror surface maps from the Advanced LIGO project. We show mode distortions that can be expected to arise due to the degeneracy of higher order spatial modes within such cavities and relate this to the theoretical analysis. Finally, we identify the mirror distortions which cause significant coupling from the LG33 mode into other order 9 modes and derive requirements for the mirror surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {For a variety of laser interferometric experiments, the thermal noise of high-reflectivity multilayer dielectric coatings limits the measurement sensitivity. Recently, monolithic high-reflection waveguide mirrors with nanostructured surfaces have been proposed to reduce the thermal noise in interferometric measurements. Drawbacks of this approach are a highly complicated fabrication process and the high susceptibility of the nanostructured surfaces to damage and pollution. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel quasi-monolithic resonant surface reflector that also avoids the thick dielectric stack of conventional mirrors but has a flat and robust surface. Our reflector is an encapsulated subwavelength grating that is based on silicon. We measured a high reflectivity of 93\% for a wavelength of $\lambda$$=$ 1.55 $\mu$m under normal incidence. Perfect reflectivities are possible in theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method to analyze the coupling of lateral displacements in nanoscale structures, in particular waveguide grating mirrors (WGMs), into the phase of a reflected Gaussian beam using a finite-difference time-domain simulation. Such phase noise is of interest for using WGMs in high-precision interferometry. We show that, to the precision of our simulations (10\&\#x2212;7\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;rad), waveguide mirrors do not couple lateral displacement into phase noise of a reflected beam and that WGMs are therefore not subject to the same stringent alignment requirements as previously proposed layouts using diffraction gratings.},

  Abstract                 = {According to quantum measurement theory, “speed meters”—devices that measure the momentum, or speed, of free test masses—are immune to the standard quantum limit (SQL). It is shown that a Sagnac-interferometer gravitational-wave detector is a speed meter and therefore in principle it can beat the SQL by large amounts over a wide band of frequencies. It is shown, further, that, when one ignores optical losses, a signal-recycled Sagnac interferometer with Fabry-Perot arm cavities has precisely the same performance, for the same circulating light power, as the Michelson speed-meter interferometer recently invented and studied by Purdue and the author. The influence of optical losses is not studied, but it is plausible that they be fairly unimportant for the Sagnac interferometer, as for other speed meters. With squeezed vacuum (squeeze factor e^{-2R}=0.1) injected into its dark port, the recycled Sagnac interferometer can beat the SQL by a factor sqrt(10)≃3 over the frequency band 10Hz≲f≲150Hz using the same circulating power Ic∼820 kW as is to be used by the (quantum limited) second-generation Advanced LIGO interferometers—if other noise sources are made sufficiently small. It is concluded that the Sagnac optical configuration, with signal recycling and squeezed-vacuum injection, is an attractive candidate for third-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors (LIGO-III and EURO).},

  Abstract                 = {Thermally induced fluctuations impose a fundamental limit on precision measurement. In optical interferometry, the current bounds of stability and sensitivity are dictated by the excess mechanical damping of the high-reflectivity coatings that comprise the cavity end mirrors. Over the last decade, the dissipation of these amorphous multilayer reflectors has at best been reduced by a factor of two. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm in optical coating technology based on direct-bonded monocrystalline multilayers, which exhibit both intrinsically low mechanical loss and high optical quality. Employing these ‘crystalline coatings’ as end mirrors in a Fabry–Pérot cavity, we obtain a finesse of 150,000. More importantly, at room temperature, we observe a thermally limited noise floor consistent with a tenfold reduction in mechanical damping when compared with the best dielectric multilayers. These results pave the way for the next generation of ultra-sensitive interferometers, as well as for new levels of laser stability.},

  Abstract                 = {The speed meter concept has been identified as a technique that can potentially provide laser-interferometric measurements at a sensitivity level which surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) over a broad frequency range. As with other sub-SQL measurement techniques, losses play a central role in speed meter interferometers and they ultimately determine the quantum noise limited sensitivity that can be achieved. So far in the literature, the quantum noise limited sensitivity has only been derived for lossless or lossy cases using certain approximations (for instance that the arm cavity round trip loss is small compared to the arm cavity mirror transmission). In this article we present a generalized, analytical treatment of losses in speed meters that allows accurate calculation of the quantum noise limited sensitivity of Sagnac speed meters with arm cavities. In addition, our analysis allows us to take into account potential imperfections in the interferometer such as an asymmetric beam splitter or differences of the reflectivities of the two arm cavity input mirrors. Finally, we use the examples of the proof-of-concept Sagnac speed meter currently under construction in Glasgow and a potential implementation of a Sagnac speed meter in the Einstein Telescope to illustrate how our findings affect Sagnac speed meters with metre- and kilometre-long baselines.},

High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},

  Abstract                 = {The ongoing global effort to detect gravitational waves continues to push the limits of precision measurement while aiming to provide a new tool for understanding both astrophysics and fundamental physics. Squeezed states of light offer a proven means of increasing the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, potentially increasing the rate at which astrophysical sources are detected by more than 1 order of magnitude. Since radiation pressure noise plays an important role in advanced detectors, frequency-dependent squeezing will be required. In this paper we propose a practical approach to producing frequency-dependent squeezing for Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and similar interferometric gravitational wave detectors. This work focuses on “realistic filter cavities” in the sense that optical losses in the filter cavity and squeezed light source consistent with current technology are considered. The filter cavity solution proposed for Advanced LIGO is “practical” in that it considers the nonquantum noise and readout scheme of the interferometer and a potential implementation geometry in the Advanced LIGO vacuum envelope.},

  Abstract                 = {Mirror coatings play a crucial role in the performance of laser interferometers devoted to gravitational wave detection such as Virgo and LIGO. Mechanical losses in the coating material limit the sensitivity of the detectors due to the associated mirror thermal noise. The absorption of light in the coating induces a thermal lens in the mirror substrate which reduces the quality of the optical interference and requires sophisticated thermal compensation systems. This paper describes the work ongoing at LMA in order to reduce mechanical losses and optical absorption in the coating. The results obtained by doping Ta 2 O 5 layers and testing different high-index materials are described. Finally the performances of different potential coatings are compared and the results obtained with a 40 kg mirror are reported. Titania doped Ta 2 O 5 shows mechanical losses of 2 × 10 −4 and absorption below 0.5 ppm. Nb 2 O 5 appears to be the best competitor from the thermal noise point of view but it has an optical absorption four to five times larger.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffraction gratings have been proposed as core optical elements in future laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper, we derive equations for the coupling between alignment noise and phase noise at diffraction gratings. In comparison to a standard reflective component (mirror or beam splitter) the diffractive nature of the gratings causes an additional coupling of geometry changes into alignment and phase noise. Expressions for the change in angle and optical path length of each outgoing beam are provided as functions of a translation or rotation of the incoming beam with respect to the grating. The analysis is based entirely on the grating equation and the geometry of the set-up. We further analyse exemplary optical set-ups which have been proposed for the use in future gravitational-wave detectors. We find that the use of diffraction gratings yields a strong coupling of alignment noise into phase noise. By comparing the results with the specifications of current detectors, we show that this additional noise coupling results in new, challenging requirements for the suspension and isolation systems for optical components.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the first demonstration of a fully suspended 10m Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating a waveguide grating as the coupling mirror. The cavity was kept on resonance by reading out the length fluctuations via the Pound-Drever-Hall method and employing feedback to the laser frequency. From the achieved finesse of 790 the grating reflectivity was determined to exceed 99.2\% at the laser wavelength of 1064 nm, which is in good agreement with rigorous simulations. Our waveguide grating design was based on tantala and fused silica and included a $\approx$ 20 nm thin etch stop layer made of Al2O3 that allowed us to define the grating depth accurately and preserve the waveguide thickness during the fabrication process. Demonstrating stable operation of a waveguide grating featuring high reflectivity in a suspended low-noise cavity, our work paves the way for the potential application of waveguide gratings as mirrors in high-precision interferometry, for instance in future gravitational wave observatories.},

  Abstract                 = {A 10 m prototype interferometer facility is currently being set up at the AEI in Hannover, Germany. The prototype interferometer will be housed inside a 100 m 3 ultra-high vacuum envelope. Seismically isolated optical tables inside the vacuum system will be interferometrically interconnected via a suspension platform interferometer. Advanced isolation techniques will be used, such as inverted pendulums and geometrical anti-spring filters in combination with multiple-cascaded pendulum suspensions, containing an all-silica monolithic last stage. The light source is a 35 W Nd:YAG laser, geometrically filtered by passing it through a photonic crystal fibre and a rigid pre-modecleaner cavity. Laser frequency stabilisation will be achieved with the aid of a high finesse suspended reference cavity in conjunction with a molecular iodine reference. Coating thermal noise will be reduced by the use of Khalili cavities as compound end mirrors. Data acquisition and control of the experiments is based on the AdvLIGO digital control and data system. The aim of the project is to test advanced techniques for GEO 600 as well as to conduct experiments in macroscopic quantum mechanics. Reaching standard quantum-limit sensitivity for an interferometer with 100 g mirrors and subsequently breaching this limit, features most prominently among these experiments. In this paper we present the layout and current status of the AEI 10 m Prototype Interferometer project.},

  Abstract                 = {The detection of gravitational waves in the years to come will be the result of decades of work by institutions around the world to design and construct instruments to probe the characteristic strain of space-time on the smallest scales. Once detected, an entirely new field of study will be open to astronomy, allowing probing of the interior structure of massive celestial objects and insight into the very beginning of the universe. However, this will by no means signal the end of this work. Efforts will continue to push the sensitivity limits of detectors ever lower, at the same time widening our gravitational wave horizon to encompass sources at greater distances. Soon, gravitational wave detectors are expected to be operating at the Standard Quantum Limit throughout much of their detection bandwidth. Novel techniques will need to be employed to probe beneath this level. One such method involves the use of opto-mechanical rigidity, or "optical springs". This technique couples the suspended optics of a Fabry-Pérot cavity together using only the radiation pressure force transferred between them, transforming the system into the harmonic oscillator regime and thus increasing sensitivity in a narrow band about the associated resonance. If this technique is to be applied to a large-scale gravitational wave detector, the effect must be well-characterised and robust control methods investigated. Importantly, the optical spring effect is observed to arise in any gravitational wave detector operating with high power, providing further motivation for the study of control systems to cope with them. It has further been suggested that multiple optical springs may be employed in a single system, either for improved optical stability such that electronic feedback may be reduced, or else to favourably re-shape the noise spectrum of the instrument for wider-band sensitivity improvement. We present the design and commissioning of an experiment at the Glasgow 10m Prototype Interferometer Laboratory to investigate characterisation and control methods for coupled optical spring systems. The experimental system consists of two 10m cavities coupled mechanically by a shared end test mass. Each cavity can be detuned to facilitate opto-mechanical coupling, the combined effects of which are studied. The design of this experiment is covered from initial simulations through mechanical design, testing and installation. Robust digital control loops are built, providing techniques for reliable lock-acquisition of high-finesse optical cavities and maintenance of stability in the presence of strong opto-mechanical effects. A number of experiments are performed to examine the interactions between optical springs in both cavities and the control loops which maintain them. We observe marked power stability over significant periods of time to enable precision measurement of optical spring resonant responses in both cavities, and confirm the power-dependence of the optical spring effect. Techniques are described for the maintenance of stable cavity lock in the presence of strong optical springs and anti-springs, and complex responses resulting from couplings of multiple springs to loop gains are characterised. This work will inform the design of future gravitational wave detectors, which are expected to employ optical spring technologies in order to push further beneath the Standard Quantum Limit.},

  Abstract                 = {The second generation of large scale interferometric gravitational wave (GW) detectors will be limited by quantum noise over a wide frequency range in their detection band. Further sensitivity improvements for future upgrades or new detectors beyond the second generation motivate the development of measurement schemes to mitigate the impact of quantum noise in these instruments. Two strands of development are being pursued to reach this goal, focusing both on modifications of the well-established Michelson detector configuration and development of different detector topologies. In this paper, we present the design of the worldʼs first Sagnac speed meter (SSM) interferometer, which is currently being constructed at the University of Glasgow. With this proof-of-principle experiment we aim to demonstrate the theoretically predicted lower quantum noise in a Sagnac interferometer compared to an equivalent Michelson interferometer, to qualify SSM for further research towards an implementation in a future generation large scale GW detector, such as the planned Einstein telescope observatory.},

  Abstract                 = {The international network of gravitational wave detectors is currently undergoing sensitivity upgrades (aLIGO, aVIRGO and GEO-HF) which will lead to the first detection and subsequent observation of a rich variety of astrophysical sources. To obtain a factor of 10 improvement in the strain sensitivity at low frequencies requires the use of ultralow mechanical loss materials and monolithic fused silica suspensions, optimized mirror coatings and the development of cutting edge techniques to super-polish and figure the interferometer optics. The possibility of applying incremental upgrades to the second generation detectors can be realized by making small but significant changes to the suspensions and/or optical mirror coatings. This includes the use of longer suspensions to increase the dissipation dilution, the development of techniques to reduce the surface loss in fused silica suspensions and methods to lower the mechanical loss from the metal springs used to support the test mass. Such upgrades can potentially improve the strain sensitivity by a factor of 2.5. Looking beyond 2015, the development of techniques to further improve the sensitivity by one order of magnitude are discussed. The third generation detectors will be located underground and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures. At low temperatures, silicon is a particularly promising candidate material as it displays good thermal conductivity, high tensile strength and zero thermal expansion coefficient at 120 K, 18 K and T → 0 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Advanced gravitational wave detectors, currently under construction, are expected to directly observe gravitational wave signals of astrophysical origin. The Einstein Telescope (ET), a third-generation gravitational wave detector, has been proposed in order to fully open up the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy. In this paper we describe sensitivity models for ET and investigate potential limits imposed by fundamental noise sources. A special focus is set on evaluating the frequency band below 10 Hz where a complex mixture of seismic, gravity gradient, suspension thermal and radiation pressure noise dominates. We develop the most accurate sensitivity model, referred to as ET-D, for a third-generation detector so far, including the most relevant fundamental noise contributions.},

We present measurements of the effect of post-deposition heat treatment on the temperature dependence of the mechanical dissipation in ion-beam sputtered tantalum pentoxide between 11 K and 300 K. We find that the temperature dependence of the dissipation is strongly dependent on the temperature at which the heat treatment was carried out, and we have identified three dissipation peaks occurring at different heat treatment temperatures. At temperatures below 200 K, the magnitude of the loss was found to increase with higher heat treatment temperatures, indicating that heat treatment is a significant factor in determining the level of coating thermal noise.},

A piezoelectric driver on one of the interferometer mirrors was used to generate subangstrom (3 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}14-m) vibrations of known amplitude. The measured displacement sensitivity of the system in the kilohertz region was 1.3{\texttimes}10-14 m/Hz12, which compares well with the calculated photon noise limit of 1.06{\texttimes}10-14 m/Hz12. This is the smallest vibrational displacement measured directly with a laser to date.},

In particular we describe the triple pendulum, which is a key aspect of the overall system, discuss the details of the mechanical design, present transfer functions of the isolation performance, and display examples of impulse responses for the local control used to damp the low frequency modes of the triple pendulum. This local control is achieved using co-located sensing and feedback at the highest mass of the triple pendulum, providing a significant attenuation of local control noise to the fused silica test mass, the lowest mass of the triple pendulum. In order to enhance the vertical isolation, the triple pendulum will incorporate two stages of cantilever springs, and fused silica fibers will be used in the lowest pendulum stage in order to minimize thermal noise from the pendulum modes. It is expected that the thermal noise associated with the internal modes of the fused silica test mass (mass ∼6 kg) will set the sensitivity limit for GEO 600 from 50 to ∼200 Hz. The measured performance from individual stages of the prototype suspension system indicates that a seismicnoise level which is a factor ∼3 lower than this thermal noise level at 50 Hz can be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently planned second-generation gravitational-wave laser interferometers such as Advanced LIGO exploit the extensively investigated signal-recycling technique. Candidate Advanced LIGO configurations are usually designed to have two resonances within the detection band, around which the sensitivity is enhanced: a stable optical resonance and an unstable optomechanical resonance—which is upshifted from the pendulum frequency due to the so-called optical-spring effect. As an alternative to a feedback control system, we propose an all-optical stabilization scheme, in which a second optical spring is employed, and the test mass is trapped by a stable ponderomotive potential well induced by two carrier light fields whose detunings have opposite signs. The double optical spring also brings additional flexibility in reshaping the noise spectral density and optimizing toward specific gravitational-wave sources. The presented scheme can be extended easily to a multi-optical-spring system that allows further optimization.},

The model is used to describe and analyze this resonancebehavior of the grating--waveguide structures as a function of wavelengthand incidence angle. The analysis is verified experimentally with semiconductor(InGaAsP/InP) structures at wavelengths of 1.55 $\mu$m and also with dielectric(silicon nitride/SiO2)structures at wavelengths of 0.6 $\mu$m. All of the structures were formedby electron beam lithography and chemical vapor deposition.

  Abstract                 = {Brownian noise of dielectric mirror coatings is expected to be one of the limiting noise sources, at the peak sensitivity, of next generation ground based interferometric gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The use of higher-order Laguerre–Gauss (LG) beams has been suggested to reduce the effect of coating thermal noise in future generations of gravitational wave detectors. In this paper we describe the first test of interferometry with higher-order LG beams in an environment similar to a full-scale gravitational wave detector. We compare the interferometric performance of higher-order LG modes and the fundamental mode beams, injected into a 10 m long suspended cavity that features a finesse of 612, a value chosen to be typical of future gravitational wave detectors. We found that the expected mode degeneracy of the injected LG 3, 3 beam was resolved into a multiple peak structure, and that the cavity length control signal featured several nearby zero crossings. The break up of the mode degeneracy is due to an astigmatism (defined as | R cy − R cx |) of 5.25 ± 0.5 cm on one of our cavity mirrors with a radius of curvature ( R c ) of 15 m. This observation agrees well with numerical simulations developed with the FINESSE software. We also report on how these higher-order mode beams respond to the misalignment and mode mismatch present in our 10 m cavity. In general we found the LG 3, 3 beam to be considerably more susceptible to astigmatism and mode mismatch than a conventional fundamental mode beam. Therefore the potential application of higher-order Laguerre–Gauss beams in future gravitational wave detectors will impose much more stringent requirements on both mode matching and mirror astigmatism.},

To this end, among various proposed methods of quantum noise suppression or signal amplification, the most elaborate approach implies a so-called *xylophone* configuration of two Michelson interferometers, each optimised for its own frequency band, with a combined broadband sensitivity well below the SQL. Albeit ingenious, it is a rather costly solution. We demonstrate that changing the optical scheme to a Sagnac interferometer with weak detuned signal recycling and frequency dependent input squeezing can do almost as good a job, as the xylophone for significantly lower spend. We also show that the Sagnac interferometer is more robust to optical loss in filter cavity, used for frequency dependent squeezed vacuum injection, than an analogous Michelson interferometer, thereby reducing building cost even more.},

  Abstract                 = {The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus. The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.},

  Abstract                 = {The GEO 600 gravitational wave detector uses advanced technologies including signal recycling and monolithic fused-silica suspensions to achieve a sensitivity close to the kilometre scale LIGO and VIRGO detectors. As soon as the design sensitivity of GEO 600 is reached, the detector will be operated as part of the worldwide network to acquire data of scientific interest. The limited infrastructure at the GEO site does not allow for a major upgrade of the detector. Hence the GEO collaboration decided to improve the sensitivity of the GEO detector by small sequential upgrades some of which will be tested in prototypes first. The development, test and installation of these upgrades are named 'The GEO-HF Project.' This paper describes the upgrades considered in the GEO-HF project as well as their scientific reasons. We will describe the changes in the GEO 600 infrastructure and the prototype work that is planned to support these upgrades. Finally, we will point to some laboratory research that identifies new technologies or optical configurations that might undergo a transition into detector subsystems within the GEO-HF project.},

  Abstract                 = {The GEO 600 laser interferometer with 600 m armlength is part of a worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors. Due to the use of advanced technologies like multiple pendulum suspensions with a monolithic last stage and signal recycling, the anticipated sensitivity of GEO 600 is close to the initial sensitivity of detectors with several kilometres armlength. This paper describes the subsystems of GEO 600, the status of the detector by September 2001 and the plans towards the first science run.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffraction gratings affect the absolute phase of light in a way that is not obvious from the usual derivation of optical paths using the grating equation. For example, consider light which encounters first one and then the second of two parallel gratings. If one grating is moved parallel to its surface, the phase of the light diffracted from the grating pair is shifted by 2π each time the grating is moved by one grating constant, even though the geometric path length is not altered by the motion. This additional phase shift must be included when incorporating diffraction gratings in interferometers.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a new geometry for electrostatic actuators to be used in sensitive laser interferometers, suited for prototype and table top experiments related to gravitational wave detection with mirrors of 100 g or less. The arrangement consists of two plates at the sides of the mirror (test mass), and therefore does not reduce its clear aperture as a conventional electrostatic drive (ESD) would do. Using the sample case of the AEI-10 m prototype interferometer, we investigate the actuation range and the influence of the relative misalignment of the ESD plates with respect to the test mass. We find that in the case of the AEI-10 m prototype interferometer, this new kind of ESD could provide a range of 0.28 μ m when operated at a voltage of 1 kV. In addition, the geometry presented is shown to provide a reduction factor of about 100 in the magnitude of the actuator motion coupling to the test mass displacement. We show that therefore in the specific case of the AEI-10 m interferometer, it is possible to mount the ESD actuators directly on the optical table without spoiling the seismic isolation performance of the triple stage suspension of the main test masses.},
