\section{Event GW150914}
\checkme{One billion years ago}, a pair of black holes, one with \num{36} solar masses and another with \num{29} solar masses, merged into a single black hole with \num{62} solar masses. The missing energy equivalent to \num{3} solar masses was radiated away in the form of gravitational waves.

At 09:50:45 \gls{UTC} on \nth{14} September 2015, gravitational waves from the black hole passed through the \LIGO{} Livingston detector, perturbing the mirrors by \checkme{\SI{e-18}{\meter}} and creating a signal large enough for the electronics controlling the interferometer to detect the ripple in space time more than \checkme{23} times above the noise. Seven milliseconds later, the same wavefront passed the \LIGO{} Hanford detector and moved the mirrors in the opposite direction. At that moment, for the first time in human history, a gravitational wave had been detected.

From the gravitational waveform witnessed at the \LIGO{} sites it was possible to determine the type and parameters of the waves' source. \emph{\GWFIRSTEVENT{}}'s waveform can be observed in Figure\,\ref{fig:gw150914}. This waveform, consistent with a binary black hole merger, swept up in frequency (the \emph{inspiral}) before combining (the \emph{merger}) and creating an audible ``chirp''. The signal was only above each detector's noise level from a frequency of around \checkme{x}. Not only did \LIGO{} make the first observation of a gravitational wave, it also made the first detection of a binary black hole system. The window into the universe opening up due to the \LIGO{}\textemdash and the worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors in operation and under assembly, GEO-600, Virgo and KAGRA\textemdash represents a new opportunity to study the universe in a completely different way. Some secrets have already been learned, but there are surely many more to be uncovered. Although this is just the beginning of gravitational astronomy, work is already under way to produce bigger and better gravitational wave detectors both on the Earth and in Space.

\section{General relativity and gravitational waves}
A consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravitational waves are produced by changes in the quadrupole moment of a distribution of mass. Changes in the lower order monopole and dipole terms are forbidden due to energy and momentum conservation, meaning that the effect a gravitational wave has on spacetime is to stretch it in one direction while contracting it in another. This strain can be expressed as a linear combination of ``plus'' and ``cross'' polarisation terms, shown for an initially circular ring of test particles as a function of phase angle in Figure\,\ref{fig:gravitational-wave-polarisation}.

As the wave travels, it stretches spacetime in one direction while contracting it in the other in an elliptic behaviour. A gravitational wave's propagation can be described as a linear combination of the two polarisations.}

\subsection{Sources}
Gravitational waves from Earth-bound mass distributions, including the Earth itself, are not even remotely detectable. The strain in spacetime produced by such objects is so weak that there is no hope for us to make such a detection with any known technology. A good estimate for the strain produced by a pair of rotating objects is given in \cite{Sathyaprakash2009} as\footnote{Note that the equation in question, (9) in \cite{Sathyaprakash2009}, has been converted here into SI units.}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:happrox}
  h \lesssim \frac{2 G \left( M v^{2} \right)_{\text{nonspherical}}}{c^4 r},
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\left( M v^{2} \right)_{\text{nonspherical}}$ is the kinetic energy associated with the non-spherical parts of the source, $c$ is the speed of light and $r$ is the distance to the source. To get an idea of what the spacetime strain would be for man-made sources, we can consider as in \cite{Sathyaprakash2009} the case of two cars of mass $M = \SI{e3}{\kilo\gram}$ attached to opposite ends of a rod of length $d = \SI{10}{\meter}$, spinning about its centre in a centrifuge at a frequency of $f = \SI{10}{\hertz}$. The tangential velocity of the cars will be around $2 \pi f d \approx \SI{600}{\meter\per\second}$. Placing the detector one wavelength away, and using Equation\,\ref{eq:happrox}, the strain turns out to be around $\SI{4e-43}{}$. To be able to detect such a strain, Advanced LIGO would require an improvement in sensitivity of \SI{20}{} orders of magnitude, which is clearly ludicrous.

A pair of solar-mass objects orbiting each other at \SI{100}{\hertz} within \SI{50}{\mega\lightyear} produces a strain of only one part in \SI{e21}{}, which is a strain only now detectable after decades of detector development, and a feat thought almost impossible by scientists of the early \nth{20} Century. It is only the waves produced by the most massive objects in the universe which we have any chance of detecting with the state of the art: black holes, compact binary neutron stars and supernovae amongst others. Even then, gravitational radiation is only produced by the presence of a changing quadrupole moment, and so only a subset of sources that happen to be in coalescence or contain surface asymmetries produce waves we have the ability to detect.

\section{Multi-messenger astronomy}
From Equation\,\ref{eq:happrox} we can see that gravitational waves propagate with a $\frac{1}{r}$ law, in that the amplitude of a wave decays as the linear inverse of distance $r$. Contrast that to electromagnetic (\gls{EM}) radiation, with which virtually all astronomy has thus far been conducted, where the $\frac{1}{r^2}$ law limits sensitivity. Combined observations in the \gls{EM} and gravitational wave spectrum\textemdash so-called \emph{multi-messenger} astronomy\textemdash allows researchers to learn even more about the universe by using information gathered from one set of detectors to make targeted searches of the other. One aspect, so-called \emph{\gls{EM} follow-up} can be carried out after a gravitational wave detection to learn more about the source. Another is the ability for visual observations of events such as supernovae to focus analysis efforts of the vast quantities of detector data produced by the gravitational wave observatories. The long term goal of researchers in the field of astronomy is for a worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors to compliment the existing network of \gls{EM} telescopes.

\section{Development of the gravitational wave detector}
The first attempts to detect gravitational waves began with Joseph Weber's studies in the 1960s with his \emph{Weber bar} \cite{Weber1960}. This was a device developed to act as a strain meter, with piezoelectric sensors placed on the surface of an aluminium cylinder to convert changes in length into electrical signals. Whilst the expected change in length of such a cylinder from gravitational radiation would in most cases be tiny\textemdash \checkme{of the order \SI{1e-22}{\meter} for a particularly loud source}\textemdash the resonant frequency of the cylinder, typically in the kilohertz range, acts to enhance the amplitude of the length change. The sensitivity of such a bar as a function of frequency is determined in part by its quality factor (Q), with a necessary trade-off being made between peak sensitivity (high Q) and detection bandwidth (low Q). As sources of gravitational radiation are almost universally weak, the only reasonable hope of making such a detection is to choose a high Q material and hope for a favourable signal frequency.

The original resonant bar detectors were evolved over time to become cryogenic, to decrease the effect of thermal noise; and spherical, to maximise the test mass's Q. Despite such improvements the peak sensitivity of state-of-the-art resonant bar detectors was surpassed by interferometric gravitational wave detectors in 2003 \cite{Pitkin2011} after it was shown that second generation detectors would offer superior sensitivity across a much wider bandwidth \cite{Harry2002a}. The interferometer was first suggested as a means for gravitational wave detection shortly after the introduction of the Weber bar\footnote{The first known example being by Gertsenshtein and Pustovoit in the Soviet \emph{Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics} in 1962.}, but efforts to build prototypes and understand the significant sources of noise only gained momentum in the 1970s \cite{Moss1971, Weiss1972}.

Using the \emph{local Lorenz} gauge an incident gravitational wave can be described as a change in length between the cavity mirrors in each arm of the interferometer. The primary degree of freedom a gravitational wave would excite is the differential mode of the arm lengths, \LMINUS{}, which can be defined in terms of the position of the end test masses (\glspl{ETM}) $x_{\textrm{A}}^{\textrm{ETM}}$ and $x_{\textrm{B}}^{\textrm{ETM}}$ in arms A and B, respectively, as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:darm}
  \textrm{\LMINUS{}} = \frac{x_{\textrm{A}}^{\textrm{ETM}} - x_{\textrm{B}}^{\textrm{ETM}}}{2}.
\end{equation}
Gravitational wave induced phase modulation can also be described with the \emph{transverse traceless} gauge as a change in the refractive index of the light between the arms. The effect is equivalent.

Over the course of the 1980s the \MI{} topology shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:mi} was developed into a very sensitive gravitational wave detection apparatus. The following subsections describe some of the key improvements made to the \MI{}.

\subsubsection{The simplest interferometer}
Gravitational waves modulate the phase of light, and the amount of modulation depends on the ratio of the carrier light's frequency $f_0$ and the gravitational wave frequency $f_g$. The simplest detector can be made by taking coherent light from a laser, splitting it into two parts then shining one on a mirror. Comparing the phase of the reflected light field to the other light field it is possible to detect passing gravitational waves by an additional phase accumulation on the returning light on top of the expected round trip phase with respect to the first. The change in the arm length $\Delta L$ with respect to the nominal length $L$, which gives the gravitational wave's \emph{strain}, is then given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:freq-to-length}
  \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{\Delta f}{f},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta f$ is the measured change in laser frequency at the detector normalised by the carrier frequency $f$.

The aforementioned approach has a number of disadvantages. Using the standard ground-based gravitational wave detector wavelength ($\lambda_0 = \SI{1064}{\nano\meter}$), the effect of the gravitational wave on the light is, when the arm length is optimal for a wave of frequency $\SI{e3}{\hertz}$, of the order $\frac{f_0}{f_g} = \frac{\SI{e14}{}}{\SI{e3}{}} = \SI{e11}{}$. It has been known for some time \checkme{where?} that gravitational radiation from likely sources reach us with strain of at most \SI{e-21}{} meaning that the interferometer's electronics would need to be capable of making a phase measurement of at least \SI{e-10}{\radian}: a very difficult feat. Furthermore, the optimal antenna length for a gravitational wave detector is $\frac{c_0}{4 f_g}$ \cite{Abbott2016a}, as with electromagnetic antennae, and so for this frequency the arm would ideally be \SI{75}{\kilo\meter}. This is clearly impractical for ground based detectors.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:fabry-perot-cavities}\FP{} arm cavities}
One way to simultaneously reduce the phase measurement requirement and the effective arm length is to introduce a \FP{} arm cavity\footnote{Other techniques were tested around this time such as delay lines, though they were found to have additional technical challenges for no greater benefit \note{cite something from Garching?}.}. This cavity increases a photon's effective path length by reflecting it many times between two partially transmitting mirrors. While this improves the phase measurement requirement by approximately the cavity gain (a function of the mirror reflectivities, typically of the order \num{100} to \num{1000}), this still leaves the interferometer susceptible to laser frequency fluctuations. As a laser frequency fluctuation has an effect on the phase of the light measured at some fixed distance via Equation\,\ref{eq:freq-to-length}, such noise is indistinguishable from length changes caused by passing gravitational waves. This problem can be addressed through the use of a second \FP{} arm cavity with input light from the same laser. By placing two arm cavities at the reflected and transmitted ports of a beam splitter, the light that recombines at the beam splitter's output port contains out-of-phase copies of the laser's frequency fluctuations which cancel. A \emph{\FPMI{}} is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fpmi}.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:power-recycling}Power recycling}
The \FPMI{} can provide good cancellation of laser frequency noise and good sensitivity to differential arm length fluctuations, but one problem is still apparent: the vast majority of the light that recombines at the beam splitter is sent back towards the laser, where it samples the position of input optics not necessarily isolated from the ground and interferes with the laser crystal. This light is typically rejected by means of a Faraday isolator, leading to power loss. To save this light from being lost, an additional mirror can be placed at the input to reflect the light returning to the light back into the interferometer. This technique is called power recycling, and it increases the power in the arms by approximately the gain of the cavity the power recycling mirror forms with each arm's input mirrors. The \ILIGO{}, \IVIRGO{} and \IVIRGO{} detectors were \PRFPMI{}s.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:signal-recycling}Signal recycling}
Signal recycling is an evolution on the \PRFPMI{}, which involves the placement of a \emph{signal recycling} mirror at the output port of the interferometer, whereby the signal sidebands created at the output of the interferometer by passing gravitational waves can be enhanced in a certain frequency band \cite{Meers1988}. The signal recycling mirror's transmissivity and position can be modified to determine the frequency range over which this enhancement occurs due to the dynamics of the cavity formed between the signal recycling mirror and the arm cavities (the \emph{signal recycling cavity}) \cite{Buonanno2001}. \emph{Tuned} signal recycling involves holding the signal recycling cavity resonant by ensuring that the carrier light's transmitted phase difference is zero, giving an enhancement below the signal recycling cavity's pole frequency. \emph{Resonant sideband extraction}, meanwhile, involves configuring the signal recycling cavity's tuning in such a way as to provide the greatest sensitive bandwidth, by choosing to make the signal recycling cavity resonant for one of the signal sidebands instead of the carrier.

One further signal recycling technique involves the use of radiation pressure induced dynamics. So-called \emph{optical springs} are created when high laser power encounters optical cavities detuned from resonance, and the resulting light-mirror interactions can result in enhanced sensitivity at the spring frequency \cite{Buonanno2002}. \emph{Detuned} signal recycling cavities invoke optical springs to enhance the sensitivity of the interferometer in a narrow band.

\subsubsection{Dual recycling with \FP{} arm cavities}
The natural combination of power and signal recycling with the \FPMI{} leads to the \emph{\DRFPMI{}}, shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:drfpmi}. This is the topology that provides the greatest sensitivity, either broadband or narrowband depending on the tuning of the signal recycling cavity, for a given laser power, arm length and mirror mass; it is therefore the topology employed in current generation detectors. The use of both power and signal recycling (\emph{dual recycling}) was demonstrated in both table-top and suspended prototype experiments \cite{Strain1991, Heinzel1998, Freise2000}, and later a dual-recycled \MI{} was demonstrated in a full-scale detector in \GEO{} \cite{Heinzel2002, Grote2004}. The \ALIGO{} detectors were the first to fully implement the \DRFPMI{} topology, and these represent the state of the art.

\section{Overview of current efforts}
As of the time of writing the \ALIGO{} detectors are online and commissioners are working towards reaching the design sensitivity. \AVIRGO{} is due to begin science operations towards the end of 2016, with \KAGRA{} due to follow in 2019. \GEOHF{} has been operational in the years since the initial detectors stopped for upgrades, and is now transitioning into a detector-scale prototype facility. Planning is also underway to build an \ALIGO{} detector in India. The eventual network of constructed and planned detectors is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:detector-network}.

Beyond this generation, plans are afoot to build facilities which will push the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector to the limit, with the so-called \emph{third generation} detectors. A European collaboration is working towards the \emph{\ET{}} and the \LSC{} is working towards \emph{\LIGOCE{}}. Efforts are also under way to complement the ground-based detectors with a space-based counterpart with significantly enhanced low frequency sensitivity, \emph{\ELISA{}}. Together, the network of ground- and space-based detectors will provide unprecedented sensitivity from frequencies of \SI{}{\milli\hertz} to \SI{}{\kilo\hertz}, presenting the ability to study the universe in unparalleled fidelity.

\section{Thesis structure}
Chapter\,\ref{c:instrumentation} introduces some theoretical foundations and motivation for the work presented in the rest of this thesis. Chapter\,\ref{c:waveguides} presents an investigation into waveguide mirrors, which offer a large potential improvement in Brownian thermal noise over conventional dielectric mirrors. One downside is the potential presence of a coupling effect between transverse motion and reflection phase. This chapter presents an experiment conducted to measure this coupling in order to give a clearer picture of this type of mirror's potential use in future gravitational wave facilities.

The next set of chapters, \ref{c:speedmeter-intro}, \ref{c:speedmeter-control} and \ref{c:esd-concept}, present a view of current research into a new type of gravitational wave interferometer: the \SSM{}. Chapter\,\ref{c:speedmeter-intro} introduces the concept in more detail and presents work performed to facilitate the measurements made in subsequent chapters and still to be made in the future. Chapter\,\ref{c:speedmeter-control} demonstrates a fundamental problem with the \SSM{} configuration which is not present with current detectors: that the controller cannot determine the displacement of the cavity mirrors at low frequencies, leading to loss of sensitivity. A solution to the problem is presented through the modelling of the complete control system, using existing measurements of the response and noise of the apparatus as well as estimates for noise in the experiment as fully assembled, backed by numerical simulations. Finally, Chapter\,\ref{c:esd-concept} outlines an experiment to test a new actuator design to be used in the \SSMEXPT{}: a plate capacitor electrostatic actuator. Designs and tests of high-voltage equipment to create the required actuation are presented, \note{along with preliminary results}.

The main body of the work concludes with Chapter\,\ref{c:et-lf-control} where the sensing and control aspects of the low frequency interferometer as part of the planned Einstein Telescope facility are presented. This interferometer is to be primarily sensitive to frequencies \checkme{below \SI{10}{\hertz}}, where existing detectors are dominated by seismic noise. Here, the state of the art sensing, controls and actuators found in the current generation of detectors must be revisited through the use of numerical simulations.

Finally, the appendices provide additional information for the enthusiastic reader to support the main work. Appendix\,\ref{a:interferometry} provides a mathematical description of a basic interferometer and derives some useful figures of merit used throughout the work to describe interferometers. Appendix\,\ref{a:simulation-tools} discusses the differences between the two main numerical simulation tools used for the presented work in Chapters \ref{c:speedmeter-intro}, \ref{c:speedmeter-control} and \ref{c:et-lf-control}.
