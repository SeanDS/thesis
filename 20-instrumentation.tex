\section{Interferometer foundations}

The effect that an interferometer has on a means of readout (e.g. a photodetector) as some variable is modulated is termed the \emph{response}. The most important response to consider in gravitational wave interferometry is the arm cavity differential degree of freedom's response to the beam splitter's output port. The response varies as a function of frequency depending on the interferometer topology and its light storage time. For instance, in a Michelson interferometer the dARM response is typically flat for frequencies below the arm cavity pole, and decaying \checkme{at a rate proportional to frequency} above. At higher frequencies, less light can be stored as the cavity cannot build up sufficient light power due to mirror loss and round-trip time. This effect is shown in \note{Figure XXX} for different end test mass reflectivities and in \note{Figure XXX} for different arm cavity lengths.

In order to calculate a response function for a set of optics, it is necessary to understand the propagation of a light field through vacuum and through optics.

\subsection{Operating point}
In precision measurement, typically an experimentalist can only infer the quantity of an underlying amplitude from a measured power. A simple example is the measurement of mirror displacement in a simple Michelson interferometer \emph{via} the photocurrent output of the photodetector. The wave is composed of the electric and magnetic fields, $E$ and $B$, respectively, each of which can be expressed as a travelling wave:
\begin{align}
  E &= E_0 \text{e}^{\text{i} \left( kx - \omega t \right)}, \\
  B &= B_0 \text{e}^{\text{i}  \left( kx - \omega t \right)},
\end{align}
where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are the initial field amplitudes, $k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave vector, $x$ is the displacement, $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $t$ is time. The intensity $S$ is the product of the two, with the magnetic field weighted by the permittivity of free space $\epsilon_0$ and speed of light in vacuum $c_0$ \checkme{check this is consistent with Living Review p31}:
\begin{equation}
  S = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 \left( E^2 + c_0^2 B^2 \right).
\end{equation}
As the $E$ and $B$ fields are orthogonal, their sum at any point in time and space remains constant. We can therefore state that the wave's intensity is proportional to the square of an ``amplitude'' $A$, expressing the combination of $E$ and $B$:
\begin{equation}
  S \propto A^2.
\end{equation}
Leaving the beam splitter towards the end of each arm, each wave in the Michelson interferometer propagates with amplitude
\begin{equation}
  A = A_{\text{in}} \text{e}^{\text{i} \left( kx - \omega t \right)},
\end{equation}
where $A_{\text{in}}$ represents the field at the beam splitter's input.

A difference in path length between the arms $\Delta x$ leads to a difference in round-trip phase between light returning to the beam splitter. With light of constant amplitude injected into the interferometer, and assuming that the light round-trip time is much quicker than the transient causing a change to the arm lengths, we can look at the superposition of returning light at the beam splitter to determine the change in path length. At the beam splitter's output port, the field superposition becomes:
\begin{equation}
  A_{\text{out}} = \frac{A_{\text{in}}}{2} \text{e}^{\text{i} \left( k \left( x + \frac{\Delta x}{2} \right) - \omega t \right)} + \frac{A_{\text{in}}}{2} \text{e}^{\text{i} \left( k \left( x - \frac{\Delta x}{2} \right) - \omega t \right)},
\end{equation}
where we assume that the path length difference caused by the transient is evenly distributed, differentially, between the two arms. The power measured by a photodetector, $P_{\text{out}}$, is then the field multiplied by its complex conjugate:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mich-p-out}
  \begin{split}
    P_{\text{out}} &\propto \langle A_{\text{out}}^*A_{\text{out}} \rangle \\
                   &= \frac{P_{\text{in}}}{2} \left( 1 + \cos \left( k \Delta x \right) \right),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
using the fact that $P_{\text{in}} = A_{\text{in}}^2$. This shows that the signal from the arm length motion is encoded in the phase of the signal witnessed by the photodetector at the output port.

Getting access to the phase information encoded within the light is more difficult than making a simple measurement of power. Sections \note{WGM PDH, controls BHD and ET DC readout} describe techniques to access this information given different noise and signal constraints.

\subsection{Numerical simulation tools}
Recall the reflection term $r$ we ignored earlier. Light propagating within an interferometer will collect reflection and transmission terms from each mirror it encounters. A photodetector placed at a port of the interferometer will then see light with amplitude and phase information representing the path it has taken through the interferometer. We have shown this effect in a trivial example involving a \FP{} cavity with one input, but the same mathematics can be used to represent any interferometer. For anything beyond the simplest of examples, we typically employ numerical simulation tools to perform the tedious calculations involved in obtaining the output signals from interferometers, with the packages Finesse \cite{Freise2004} (not to be confused with \emph{cavity} finesse) and Optickle \cite{Evans2012} being popular choices within the field of gravitational wave interferometry.

\section{Limiting noise sources in current detectors}
Gravitational wave observatories are limited by a plethora of noise sources both fundamental and technical. In order to understand how to mitigate sources of noise in interferometers, it is necessary to understand how they arise and utilise techniques to mitigate them. The initial generation of detectors was limited by a range of different noise sources, and the knowledge gained from the first science runs fed in to the design of the second generation of detectors.

The noise budget for \ALIGO{} is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:aligo-noise-budget}. At its most sensitive frequency, \ALIGO{} is limited by quantum and thermal noise, whilst at low frequencies the motion of the ground from seismic sources lets the limit. Careful design involving specially selected materials and techniques has reduced thermal noise arising from the mirror coatings and suspensions and technical noise associated with electronics and facilities. Quantum noise sets the fundamental limit given the available light power and mirror masses utilised in \ALIGO{} and \AVIRGO{}. In order to improve the sensitivity beyond the limit set by quantum noise, approaches that involve changing the nature of the quantum interactions within the interferometer have to be implemented, some of which is discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:sub-sql-techniques} and throughout the main body of this work.

\subsection{Measurement noise in gravitational wave interferometry}
Gravitational wave interferometry is ultimately a matter of signals and noise. The term ``signal'' simply refers to a wanted pattern of oscillations representing a particular variable of interest. ``Noise'', on the other hand, is unwanted oscillations that appear at the signal measurement device. The measurement of any signal necessarily entails the measurement of some noise, and so it does not make sense to talk about signal without talking about noise.

\subsubsection{\label{eq:noise-via-loss}Noise via loss}
The fluctuation dissipation theorem developed in the early \nth{20} Century showed in a general sense that fluctuations arise from loss, with the fluctuation power:
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{fluc}} \propto \frac{T}{Q},
\end{equation}
where $T$ is temperature and $Q$ is the mechanical quality factor, relating to the loss of the material. In fluids, Brownian motion is created from the thermal fluctuations of molecules within the fluid hitting and perturbing the position of suspended particles (characterised by the fluid's \emph{diffusivity}). Black body radiation arises from thermal fluctuation of electrons in matter leading to the production of electromagnetic radiation (characterised by the \emph{absorptance} of the matter). In resistors, the thermal fluctuation of electrons leads to a noise voltage (characterised by the resistance) termed Johnson-Nyquist noise.

In interferometry, noise is able to enter at points of photon loss such as open ports created by mirrors with non-unity reflectivity. More subtle points of entry arise from loss within mirror substrates and coatings, friction in actuators such as coils (arising both from Joule heating and in the rearrangement of magnetic domains) and scattering from residual gas in the vacuum system.

The effect of noise on the interferometer can be calculated by quantifying the magnitude of noise entering at the loss point and propagating this noise as if it were signal through the interferometer. The noise at a photodetector is therefore the sum of noise propagated from each point of loss. The way in which some forms of noise enters a \DRFPMI{} and propagates to the output port is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:modelling-noise}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-svg/20-modelling-noise.pdf}
  \caption[Modelling noise]{\label{fig:modelling-noise}Blah}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:snr}Signal to noise ratio}
Signal cannot be measured below the noise present on a photodetector. Maximum sensitivity can be achieved by maximising the ratio of signal power, $S$, to noise power, $N$, in the frequency band of interest. This is the \emph{signal-to-noise} ratio (SNR),
\begin{equation}
  \text{SNR} = \frac{S}{N}.
\end{equation}
In engineering circles the standard representation of signal to noise is in units of \emph{decibels} (\SI{}{\deci\bel}), defined for signal power as:
\begin{equation}
  \text{SNR}_{\SI{}{\deci\bel}} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{s}{n} \right).
\end{equation}
As this representation is logarithmic, it is a useful for expressing both small and large signals. It is borrowed from engineering circles, and is particularly popular in discussions of electronic filtering.

\subsection{Thermal noise}

Thermal noise arises from loss in materials used to reflect and focus light and to suspend test masses, where photons in the thermal state are allowed to enter the interferometer and propagate to the sensors.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:coating-thermal-noise}Coating thermal noise}
In the conceptual design for the first generation of gravitational wave detectors such as GEO-600 \cite{Willke2002} the designers were not aware that thermal noise associated with the reflective coatings on mirrors would play a significant role in the sensitivity of the interferometers. For a long time it was known that thermal noise would contribute to the sensitivity of the detectors, particularly from the bulk material forming the test masses, but it soon became clear as the detectors were being commissioned that thermal noise arising from the reflective mirror coatings would dominate the thermal noise associated with the test masses in the frequency band of interest despite forming only a tiny fraction of the test masses by volume. Investigations conducted by Harry \etal{} \cite{Harry2002, Harry2007}, among others, concluded that mechanical loss present in the dielectric coatings on the test masses led to Brownian noise creating a limit to the sensitivity of detectors across a wide range of frequencies. Contributions from thermoelastic noise, arising from the thermal expansion coefficient of the materials of the coatings \cite{Braginsky1999a}, and thermorefractive noise, arising from the change in refractive index caused by such expansion \cite{Braginsky2000a}, produce further noise contributions which will become more important as coatings with improved thermal noise contributions are developed.

Over the past two decades, efforts have been made to both quantify and reduce coating thermal noise. Particular interest is being paid to the study of coatings for cryogenically cooled mirrors, such as the sapphire (\ce{Al_2O_3}) test masses to be used in the Japanese detector \gls{KAGRA} \cite{Somiya2012}. A loss peak in the mirror material silica, for detectors until recently ubiquitous, occurs at low temperature. This makes the material unsuitable for cryogenic use, as mechanical loss will couple into the light within the interferometer and make its way to the detection port. Other materials such as sapphire do not feature this loss peak and provide lower thermal noise than silica at room temperature for a given mirror design. Coating noise is also proportional to temperature, so cryogenically cooled mirrors can offer better performance. Additionally, crystalline coatings made from compounds such as \ce{AlGaAs} can offer future detectors a coating thermal noise reduction of up to 3 over current state of the art \cite{Cole2013} if technical challenges in their manufacturing can be overcome.

The dominant contribution to coating noise in gravitational wave detectors comes from Brownian noise, given as \cite{Harry2002}:
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{x, coating}} = \frac{2 k_B T}{\pi^{3/2} f} \frac{1}{w Y} \left( \phi_{\text{sub}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{d}{w} \left( \frac{Y'}{Y} \phi_{\text{para}} + \frac{Y}{Y'} \phi_{\text{perp}} \right) \right),
\end{equation}
with $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant, temperature $T$, frequency $f$, beam size $w$, Young's moduli $Y$, \emph{loss angle} (\checkme{imaginary part of the Young's modulus}) $\phi$ and coating thickness $d$. The Young's moduli and loss angles are split into components representing the substrate and coatings, and the measurement and interaction between these components is an active area of research. Figure\,\ref{fig:aligo-noise-budget} shows coating Brownian noise jointly dominating the noise at frequencies around \SI{70}{\hertz}.

A mirror topology which avoids the use of many alternating coating layers can potentially offer an improvement in noise performance. Mirrors employing grating structures can resonantly reflect light with less coating material than similarly performing dielectric mirrors \cite{Mashev1985}, though at the expense of additional technical complexity in their utility in gravitational wave detectors \cite{Leavey2015}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:sus-thermal-noise}Suspension thermal noise}
The test masses in audio-band gravitational wave detectors are suspended from pendulum systems, and current generation observatories (with the notable exception of \KAGRA{}) all utilise fused silica (\ce{SiO2}) fibres, a technique pioneered in \GEO{}. The reason for the use of this material is that the thermal noise present within the metal steel loops used previously was high enough to impart significant motion to the test mass in the gravitational wave channel, with the noise becoming dominant at frequencies around \SI{100}{\hertz} where the interferometer would otherwise be most sensitive \cite{Hammond2012}. Due to its high quality factor, fused silica has reduced mechanical loss and therefore lower noise. Figure\,\ref{fig:aligo-noise-budget} shows that suspension thermal noise is no longer a dominant noise source, unlike in \ILIGO{} \note{make sure initial ligo is defined somewhere}.

As \KAGRA{} will be a cryogenic detector, it does not gain the same noise benefit from using fused silica. Instead, it will use crystalline sapphire which offers similar noise performance at low temperatures.

At higher frequencies, suspension \emph{violin modes} have a significant influence on the measured noise \cite{Robertson2002}. A violin mode with high quality factor can resonantly enhance noise such that it dominates all other sources in a narrow band at frequencies starting around \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}\footnote{Figure\,\ref{fig:aligo-noise-budget} appears to show that violin modes are not dominant, however the narrow linewidth of the noise is such that the resolution is insufficient to show the effect.}. This is reduced through the use of heavier test masses, which push the violin mode frequencies higher, away from the detection band, and via the use of special monitoring and damping techniques \cite{Sorazu2010} \note{reference to Advanced LIGO controls paper or document regarding damping of modes?}.

\subsection{Quantum noise}
% previously from chapter 4
Arising from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the quantum noise present within a classical interferometer\footnote{Note the misnomer: a \emph{classical} interferometer can still be limited by \emph{quantum} noise. The name refers to the readout technique, namely the measurement of classical light power to determine displacement.} limits its sensitivity.

It has been known since the time of John von Neumann \note{CITE!} that the use of certain observables can avoid the limit set by the uncertainty principle. One of the results of quantum theory is that two non-commuting observables cannot be simultaneously known to full precision. For two operators $\hat{O}_+$ and $\hat{O}_-$, there exists an error $\epsilon$:
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \hat{O}_+, \hat{O}_- \right] = \epsilon,
\end{equation}
and this means that the observables contain correlated components and as such cannot be considered entirely separate entities. Measuring one observable automatically influences the other, leading to the well-known \emph{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle}:
\begin{equation}
 \left| \Delta \hat{O}_+ \right| \cdot \left| \Delta \hat{O}_- \right| \geq
\frac{1}{2} \left| \epsilon \right|,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta$ represents the uncertainty in the given operator, in this case defined as the standard deviation.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:operator-uncertainty}Position, momentum, phase and photon number uncertainty}

In the field of gravitational wave interferometry there are two pairs of operators of particular importance, namely the position and momentum operators, $x$ and $p_x$, and the photon number and phase operators, $n$ and $\phi$, respectively. The canonical commutation relation between $x$ and $p_x$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
 | \Delta x\left( t \right) | \cdot |\Delta p\left( t \right) | \geq
\frac{\hbar}{2},
 \label{eq:heisenburguncertainty}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Consider a position measurement of a free mirror of mass $m$ being perturbed by a signal of frequency $f$. If a measurement is made at time $t$ and then again at time $t + \Delta t$, the uncertainty on the latter can be expressed in terms of the uncertainty in momentum of the mirror multiplied by the time difference:
\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \left( t + \Delta t \right) = \Delta x \left( t \right) + \Delta p_x
\left( t \right) \frac{\Delta t}{m}.
 \label{eq:heisenburgtime}
\end{equation}
This result shows that the momentum of the mirror at time $t$ influences the position of the mirror at a later time. Since momentum is position scaled by velocity, this leads to a minimum value on which $x \left( t \right)$ can take:
\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \left( t \right) \geq \sqrt{\frac{\hbar \Delta t}{2m}}.
\end{equation}
The key result to highlight here is that, even with an otherwise unperturbed mirror, the momentum imparted by the measurement at time $t$ influences the later measurement at $t + \Delta t$ in such a way that it adds uncertainty. Or, put another way, Equation\,\ref{eq:heisenburguncertainty} expresses that the smaller the error on the position of an observable in a quantum mechanical system, the greater the error on the momentum; and vice-versa.

We typically make position measurements indirectly via the change in phase of photons from a laser. In this case, the most appropriate uncertainty relation to use is the photon number-phase relation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:photon-phase-hup}
  \Delta n \Delta \phi \geq \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
Assuming that a photodetector has incident upon it $n$ photons in a given interval, the standard deviation of the number of photons detected per unit time will follow Poisson statistics, i.e. $\Delta n = \sqrt{\bar{n}}$, where $\bar{n}$ is the average photon number calculated by considering many intervals. A single photon has energy $E_P$ given by the standard relation involving frequency $f$:
\begin{equation}
  E_P = hf,
\end{equation}
and so the power in the beam at a given interval is then:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    P &= E_P n \\
      &= hfn.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The measurement of power is simply the energy multiplied by its complex conjugate, i.e. $P = E^{\ast}E$, and so we can recover the original energy of the light from the measurement of power:
\begin{equation}
  \left| E \right| = \sqrt{hfn}.
\end{equation}
Given that:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta \left| E \right|}{\Delta n} = \frac{d \left| E \right|}{dn},
\end{equation}
we can obtain the standard deviation of the measured amplitude:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:std-dev-amp}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta \left| E \right| &= \frac{d \left| E \right|}{dn} \Delta n \\
                            &= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{hf}{n}} \Delta n \\
                            &= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{hf} \\
                            &= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{E_P}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Note that this variation does not depend on photon number, and is instead defined only in terms of a fundamental constant and the laser frequency. This is the origin of quantum noise, and the lack of light power dependence justifies the inclusion of arm cavities in gravitational wave detectors as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:fabry-perot-cavities}.

The effect the amplitude variation has on the phase uncertainty can be calculated by expressing it as the fractional energy uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phase-uncertainty}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta \phi &= \frac{\Delta \left| E \right|}{\left| \bar{E} \right|} \\
                &= \frac{\sqrt{hf}}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{hf \bar{n}}} \\
                &= \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\bar{n}}} \\
                &= \frac{1}{2 \Delta n}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
From the last line in Equation\,\ref{eq:phase-uncertainty} we can recover a result resembling that given in Equation\,\ref{eq:photon-phase-hup}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:photon-phase-hup-min}
  \Delta n \Delta \phi = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
The reason for the $=$ in Equation\,\ref{eq:photon-phase-hup-min} is that an assumption has been made in Equation\,\ref{eq:std-dev-amp} that the energy uncertainty is made from equal parts amplitude and phase uncertainty. This is called a \emph{coherent state} and this approximates what a standard laser will output\footnote{Actually, lasers are typically quite incoherent on their own, and experimentalists must first ``mode clean'' the light to remove unwanted incoherent states. Special mode-cleaning cavities are implemented in most experiments to perform this task.}. Equation\,\ref{eq:photon-phase-hup} contains a $\geq$ and is therefore a general equation representing all states, including \emph{squeezed} states, which will be discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:squeezing}.

\subsubsection{Quantum shot noise}
As described in Section\,\ref{eq:noise-via-loss}, open ports in the interferometer allow vacuum noise to enter. When this noise is measured by a photodetector it is termed \emph{quantum shot noise}, and it arises directly from the phase uncertainty derived in Section\,\ref{sec:operator-uncertainty}. We change representation from discrete pulses to a continuous measurement made by a laser by representing $n$ in Equation\,\ref{eq:photon-phase-hup-min} as a light power $P$ via the relation $n = \frac{P \Delta t}{\hbar \omega_0}$, where $\omega_0$ is the laser's angular frequency. The displacement-equivalent shot noise power spectral density then arises from the phase uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:shot-noise-psd}
  S_{\text{shot}} = \frac{\hbar c^2}{P \omega_0}.
\end{equation}
As quantum noise arises from vacuum noise\textemdash spontaneous creation and annihilation of photons in the vacuum\textemdash it is a statistical random process and so the shot noise spectral density in Equation\,\ref{eq:shot-noise-psd} has equal power at all frequencies (it is \emph{white} noise).

The detrimental effect of counting statistics due to phase uncertainty is mitigated by an increase in the classical light power within the interferometer. As the noise entering the interferometer is a function of loss and is, to first order, not dependent upon laser power, higher input light power leads to an increase in signal with respect to noise and so the effect that the noise has on the output is diminished.

\subsubsection{Quantum radiation pressure noise}
Despite being massless, photons impart momentum to mirrors upon reflection proportional to their wavelength. The strongest effect this has on an interferometer is in the \emph{\gls{DC} radiation pressure} effect, which arises from the classical light power circulating within the interferometer. In a classical interferometer this radiation pressure effect expands the arm cavity length \checkme{proportionally to the light power}, with the equilibrium point being defined by the equivalence of the radiation pressure force to the mirror's restoring force. The operating point of the interferometer can be reached with simple control.

\emph{Quantum} radiation pressure, on the other hand, arises from the momentum imparted onto mirrors within the interferometer by vacuum noise injected at loss points within the interferometer. As with quantum shot noise this effect is related to the input power of the interferometer, $P$, but this time the input power facilitates the phase fluctuations that become transformed into displacement noise via the dynamics of the mirror. The mirror dynamics govern the back-action due to the imparted momentum, and because vacuum noise is white the energy imparted to the mirror is the same at all frequencies and the effect of radiation pressure therefore follows an inverse frequency relation.

The radiation pressure noise power spectral density is:

\subsubsection{\label{sec:sql}The Standard Quantum Limit}
\note{See p60 onwards of Stefan D's Living Review}
\note{Equation 150 of living review: minimum noise allowed by Q.M., i.e. Heisenberg}

The \emph{standard quantum limit} (\gls{SQL}) is a manifestation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in interferometry. It is the point at which the quadrature sum of shot and radiation pressure noise is minimised, and this occurs when the individual components are equal. For each laser power there exists a single frequency at which the \gls{SQL} can be reached, since shot and radiation pressure noise scale inversely to one another with frequency. The \gls{SQL} is commonly plotted across a given frequency range, where it forms a line which can only be crossed with special \emph{sub-\gls{SQL}} techniques.

For a given classical \MI{}, that is to say, a \MI{} lacking special readout techniques aimed at reducing quantum noise sources, it can be shown \cite{Braginsky1996} that the spectral density follows the relation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:classicalifospectrum}
  S_h = \frac{h^{2}_{SQL}}{2} \left( \frac{1}{\kappa} + \kappa \right).
\end{equation}
In above equation, $\kappa$ is defined as the \emph{opto-mechanical coupling constant}:
\begin{equation}
 \kappa = \frac{I_0}{I_{SQL}} \frac{2 \gamma^4}{\Omega^2 \left( \gamma^2 +
\Omega^2 \right)},
 \label{eq:optomechanicalcoupling}
\end{equation}
with $I_0$ the laser power, $I_{SQL}$ the laser power required to reach the \gls{SQL}, $\gamma$ the cavity half-bandwidth, and $\Omega$ the gravitational wave frequency. The interferometer's opto-mechanical coupling constant arises from fluctuations in pressure exerted by light on the mirrors due to shot noise. $I_{SQL}$ can be itself defined as:
\begin{equation}
 I_{SQL} = \frac{m L^2 \gamma^4}{4 \omega_0},
\end{equation}
with $m$ the mirror mass, $L$ the arm length and $\omega_0$ the light's angular frequency.

Equation\,\ref{eq:classicalifospectrum} can be minimised by setting $I_0 = I_{SQL}$ in Equation~\ref{eq:optomechanicalcoupling}. This yields the \gls{SQL}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:strainsql}
  h_{SQL} = \sqrt{\frac{8 \hbar}{m \Omega^2 L^2}}.
\end{equation}

The \gls{SQL} is defined at all frequencies, while the spectral density of a quantum noise limited interferometer touches the \gls{SQL} at only one frequency, defined by the mirror dynamics via $\kappa$. By making a more precise measurement, i.e. one involving more photons carrying information of the mirror motion, we see a smaller shot noise spectral density whilst we see a larger radiation pressure noise spectral density \cite{Caves1981}. This situation is illustrated in Figure\,\ref{fig:sql-vs-input-power} for different input powers.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/20-sql-vs-power.pdf}
  \caption[Standard quantum limit and the quantum noise with various input powers]{\label{fig:sql-vs-input-power}The \gls{SQL} for a Michelson interferometer with arms of length \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}, mirrors with reduced mass \SI{50}{\kilo\gram} and optimal frequency \SI{100}{\hertz}, along with quantum noise limited sensitivity curves for three different input powers. The higher the input power, the higher the strain sensitivity can be pushed, but at the expense of higher radiation pressure noise and thus higher optimal frequency for a given interferometer configuration. Quantum non-demolition techniques can be used to surpass the \gls{SQL} (see Section\,\ref{sec:sub-sql-techniques}).}
\end{figure}

An important distinction to make here is that the \gls{SQL} is defined for \emph{uncorrelated} shot and radiation pressure noise. Techniques exist in theory and practice to reduce overall noise by producing correlations between the two effects such as squeezing and variational readout, so-called \emph{quantum non-demolition} interferometry. \note{See sections...}

\subsection{Other fundamental noise}

\subsubsection{Seismic noise}
The Earth's surface vibrates with a large amplitude and slow frequency \cite{ET2011}. At around \SI{10}{\micro\hertz} tidal forces due to the gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon dominate the spectrum, producing displacements of up to \SI{100}{\micro\meter} \cite{Adhikari2004}. At around \SI{0.15}{\hertz} the swell of the ocean can be measured almost anywhere on the Earth, even far from coasts. These effects combine to produce a large amount of seismic noise at low frequencies which must be filtered. As this noise is large in amplitude, it is able to move test masses in laser cavities far enough that they no longer fulfil the resonant condition and lose light power. In almost all audio-band interferometric experiments a large degree of isolation must be utilised to mitigate seismic noise. In Advanced \gls{LIGO}, active platforms are used to damp this motion, sitting atop passive damping materials. The test masses are suspended from many pendulum stages to isolate higher frequencies such that by \SI{10}{\hertz} the ground motion is suppressed by \checkme{10 orders of magnitude}.

\subsubsection{Gravity-gradient noise}
Changes in the density of the ground near the test masses created by seismic noise can couple to the gravitational wave channel via \emph{gravity-gradient} noise, also referred to as \emph{Newtonian} noise. Few experiments have successfully been able to decouple this subtle effect from other sources of noise, but it is believed from extensive modelling effort that this noise source will represent a problem particularly for low frequency detectors such as \ETLF{} \cite{ET2011, Hild2011}. Simulations have shown a benefit in locally shaping the profile of the ground near test masses \cite{Harms2014}, potentially creating a benefit for future ground-based detectors, as well as through the subtraction of gravity-gradient noise inferred from a series of auxiliary witness sensors \cite{Harms2015}.

\subsection{Technical noise}

\subsubsection{Laser frequency noise}
A perfect laser provides output at a single, well defined frequency, or in other words, it has an infinitely narrow linewidth. In reality, such lasers do not exist and instead the output contains spectral impurities. As the laser wavelength is the ``metre stick'' by which we make measurements of length in interferometers, it is very important to ensure that the laser's wavelength, and therefore frequency, is well defined. A well designed laser will get an experimentalist part of the way there, but in most cavity experiments a frequency stabilisation control loop involving optics and electronics is necessary.

Apart from its linewidth, it is possible to represent a laser's frequency noise in terms of its noise spectral density, measurable via some heterodyne technique with a standard spectrum analyser. The effect of laser frequency noise is for a beat signal $V \left( t \right)$ to occur due to overlapping sinusoidal waves:
\begin{equation}
  V \left( t \right) = V_0 \left( t \right) \sin \left[ 2 \pi f_0 + \phi \left( t \right) \right],
\end{equation}
where $V_0 \left( t \right)$ is the beat amplitude and $\phi \left( t \right)$ is the phase difference at time $t$. We can rewrite this in terms of frequency $f \left( t \right)$,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    f \left( t \right) &= f_0 + \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{\text{d} \phi \left( t \right)}{\text{d} t} \\
                       &= f_0 + \Delta f \left( t \right),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta f \left( t \right)$ the instantaneous frequency fluctuation. The power spectral density arises from the autocorrelation between a frequency fluctuation at time $t$ and another at time $t + \Delta t$, which can be expressed in the form:
\begin{equation}
  S_{\Delta f} \left( f \right) = 2 \int^{\infty}_{0} \langle \Delta f \left( t \right) \Delta f \left( t + \Delta t \right) \rangle \text{e}^{\left( -\text{i2}\pi f \Delta t \right) \text{d}\Delta t}
\end{equation}

\note{describe RIN, etc...}

\subsubsection{Johnson-Nyquist noise}
As discussed in Section\,\ref{eq:noise-via-loss}, Johnson-Nyquist noise arises from loss within electronic conductors. The noise scales with resistance and is characterised in units of \SI{}{\volt\per\sqrthz} by the equation:
\begin{equation}
  v_{\text{n}} = \sqrt{4 k_B T R},
\end{equation}
where $v_{\text{n}}$ is the noise voltage and $R$ is the electrical resistance. The Johnson-Nyquist noise from a resistor in the \SI{}{\kilo\ohm} to \SI{}{\mega\ohm} range is comparable to the noise of some low-noise operational amplifiers at room temperature, and so care must be taken in the choice of passive and active components in the design of electronics to avoid introducing excess fluctuations.

\section{Control considerations}

\subsection{Spectral density}
In gravitational wave interferometry, a lot of thought and planning typically goes in to the design of the apparatus in order to minimise noise \emph{transients}\textemdash pulses of unwanted noise with finite energy\textemdash such as a door slam\footnote{And, of course, some forms of gravitational wave signal; though it is not the intention of experimentalists to minimise the effect of this particular source. Detectors utilise a series of \emph{vetoes} to eliminate Earth-bound noise sources with the intention that only signals of astrophysical origin are sent for analysis.}. Such transients have finite energy over a finite time, and can be entirely characterised\textemdash within measurement error\textemdash by a Fourier transform of the time series in which the event occurred. With sufficient isolation from unwanted transients, the remaining noise sources within the interferometer tend to arise from stationary, random processes, with energy approaching infinity as measurement time approaches infinity. In this circumstance, the Fourier transform of the underlying time-domain signal does not strictly exist. An alternative representation of a noise process is to represent the amount of work it performs per unit time: its power. The \emph{power spectral density} is a representation of the power present within each frequency of a signal in the steady state. This distribution can then be integrated back into a finite, steady state power.

Typically the time evolution of a particular signal is the only data an experimentalist has at their disposal in order to characterise a signal in terms of its spectral density. A true representation of the power spectral density requires, like the measurement of energy spectral density, infinite time. A compromise can be made, however, in order to estimate the power spectral density from a set of Fourier transforms of the time series. By averaging Fourier transforms of various subsets of the data $\left[ t, t + \Delta t \right]$, a power spectral density can be approximated for a particular frequency range, determined by the bounds established by the inverse of the longest and shortest subsets of the time series transformed. While this compromise is typically reasonable in most cases, and indeed essential for any finite measurement, it is unable to exclude the possibility that part of the power spectral density is formed from signal content in frequencies outwith the measured range. Longer time series measurements allow for more averaging of frequency bands, and thus a better approximation to the true power spectral density.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:squeezing}Squeezing}
\note{\cite{Caves1981} appears to be the first paper that introduces squeezing}

The use of \emph{squeezing} is an attempt to instead introduce vacuum with \emph{correlated} noise. By choosing a suitable \emph{readout quadrature}, it is possible to avoid quantum noise impinging upon observables, instead moving the noise terms into the orthogonal, unobserved quadrature. Squeezing is particularly favourable in combination with DC readout, since it is not necessary to squeeze additional \gls{RF} sidebands in addition to the carrier light.

The squeezing angle can be altered so as to be optimal for each given frequency through the use of a \emph{filter cavity}.

One such approach is to use \emph{DC readout} and \emph{squeezing}, a combination currently implemented in the detector GEO-HF \cite{Willke2006, Affeldt2014}.

Squeezing has been employed at GEO... will be employed at aLIGO+, LIGO Voyager, C.E., ET...
