\section{Introduction}

The \SSM{} interferometer topology can potentially provide enhanced sensitivity to gravitational waves in the audio-band compared to equivalent Michelson interferometers. A challenge with the \SSM{} interferometer arises from the intrinsic lack of sensitivity at low frequencies where the velocity-proportional signal is smaller than the noise associated with the sensing of the signal. Using as an example the on-going proof-of-concept \SSM{} experiment in Glasgow, we quantify the problem and present a solution involving the extraction of a small displacement-proportional signal. This displacement signal can be combined with the existing velocity signal to enhance low frequency sensitivity, and we derive optimal filters to accomplish this for different signal strengths. We show that the extraction of the displacement signal for low frequency control purposes can be performed without reducing significantly the quantum non-demolition character of this type of interferometer.

%\subsection{Stability with and without sensor blending}

The presence of arm cavities within the proof-of-concept \SSM{} gives rise to challenges not previously encountered in the control of gravitational wave detectors and other experiments involving Michelson or Sagnac interferometers, and this aspect will be addressed in this chapter. In Section\,\ref{sec:velocity-control} we describe in more detail the proof-of-concept \SSM{} experiment and its control requirements. We then describe a control strategy for the \SSM{}'s differential degree of freedom based on that of Michelson designs, and demonstrate the control challenges this approach introduces. In Section\,\ref{sec:mixed-control} we present an alternative strategy which achieves adequate control of the interferometer to reach its design sensitivity over extended periods, and in Section\,\ref{sec:noise-budget} we present a noise budget of the \SSM{} using the alternative control strategy. A summary is provided in Section\,\ref{sec:summary}.

\section{\label{sec:ssm-control}Control of the proof-of-concept experiment}

\subsection{\label{sec:ssm-dofs}Degrees of freedom}
It is obvious that the arm cavities of the \SSM{} must be held resonant in order to maintain the  stored light power required for the design sensitivity, and so these cavities represent degrees of freedom that must be controlled with active feedback. Meanwhile, the readout is insensitive to the motion of \MINT{}, since this mirror is situated at half the total round trip distance and is sensed by the counter-propagating modes at almost the same time. Other mirrors are potentially significant: the beam splitter \MSIX{} and steering mirror \MSEVEN{}, as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-layout}. As these mirrors are situated near the start of one and the end of the other modes' round trips, a velocity dependent signal is created at the \gls{BHD} readout. To assess the importance of these optics to the interferometer's \LMINUS{} sensitivity, transfer functions from individual mirrors to the \gls{BHD} port were calculated using Optickle. The results in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-mirror-tfs} show that the cavity mirrors are the most important positions to control, with the arm cavity finesse enhancing the sensitivity of the \gls{BHD} to the arm cavity mirrors such that they dominate the signals from \MSIX{} and \MSEVEN{}. \MINT{}, as expected, is very weakly coupled to the \gls{BHD} port. These results have been confirmed both with Finesse and analytically \cite{Graefke2015}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-mirror-tfs.pdf}
  \caption[Transfer functions from various mirrors in the \SSMEXPT{} to the balanced homodyne port]{\label{fig:ssm-mirror-tfs}Transfer functions from various mirrors in the \SSMEXPT{} to the balanced homodyne port. The \LMINUS{} degree of freedom, represented here as the differential motion of one ETM per arm cavity, has the strongest response as intended. The main beam splitter, \MSIX{}, and the steering mirror for cavity A, \MSEVEN{}, have response approximately one one-hundredth that of \LMINUS{}. Other mirrors, such as \MINT{}, have significantly lower coupling.}
\end{figure}

While the motion of \MINT{} can be ruled out as a degree of freedom, the effect of \MSIX{} and \MSEVEN{} is less clear cut. To assess the impact the motion from these mirrors has on \LMINUS{} sensitivity, a calculation of the effect of seismic noise from \MSEVEN{} to the \gls{BHD} can be made. \MSIX{} need not be considered here for three reasons: the transfer function is almost identical to that of \MSEVEN{} and so we need only calculate one, the beam splitter optic will be heavier than that of \MSEVEN{} and so will couple less seismic noise, and the suspension design\textemdash a work in progress at the time of writing\textemdash is intended to have better isolation than that of \MSEVEN{}'s auxiliary suspension.

Measurements of the seismic motion present upon the ground outside the vacuum system can be propagated through a model of the passive seismic isolation within the vacuum system to obtain the effective seismic motion of the tables upon which the suspensions sit. The seismic motion of \MSEVEN{} can then be calculated by multiplying this spectrum with the transfer function of the auxiliary suspension from the table to the test mass, taken from a state-space model. This seismic noise can be projected into an effective differential arm cavity motion displacement spectral density by multiplying it by the ratio of the transfer functions of \MSEVEN{} and \LMINUS{}\footnote{This is the same as multiplying the motion of \MSEVEN{} by its transfer function to the \gls{BHD} port to yield a signal in \SI{}{\watt\per\sqrthz}, and dividing by the transfer function from \LMINUS{} to the \gls{BHD} to yield an effective motion in terms of \LMINUS{}.}. This can be compared with the requirement for sensitivity of the \gls{BHD} to \LMINUS{}. Figure\,\ref{fig:m7-seismic-noise} shows that \MSEVEN{} will not introduce significant noise above \SI{100}{\hertz}, assuming a vertical to longitudinal coupling level of 1\%. From this result we can also conclude that \MSIX{} will most likely not present a problem, for the reasons explained earlier.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-m7-seismic-noise.pdf}
  \caption[Effective \LMINUS{} seismic noise contribution from \MSEVEN{}]{\label{fig:m7-seismic-noise}Effective \LMINUS{} seismic noise contribution from \MSEVEN{}. This is calculated by taking a seismic noise spectral density for the laboratory near the vacuum system and propagating it through damping and suspension models to obtain the motion of the \MSEVEN{} test mass. From this point, the response on the \gls{BHD} can be calculated from the transfer function shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-mirror-tfs}, and this in turn can be expressed in units of differential arm cavity motion by dividing by the response of \LMINUS{} to the \gls{BHD}. The requirement is given only for frequencies above \SI{100}{\hertz} where the measurement of reduced radiation pressure noise will be made, and this figure shows that seismic motion of \MSEVEN{} will not represent a significant problem to the sensitivity of the experiment in the desired band. The results from \MSEVEN{} apply to the main beam splitter, \MSIX{}, where it is expected the heavier test mass will reduce the effect of seismic noise even further.}
\end{figure}

From the results in Figures \ref{fig:ssm-mirror-tfs} and \ref{fig:m7-seismic-noise} it can be concluded that there is only one significant degree of freedom to control in the interferometer in order to meet the sensitivity requirement above \SI{100}{\hertz}, where the measurement of reduced radiation pressure noise will be made. It should, however, be noted that the desired \gls{BHD} homodyne angle depends on the path length \MELEVEN{} to \MSIXTEEN{}. This is an auxiliary control loop not considered part of the main longitudinal control strategy, and will be the subject of future work.

\subsection{Sideband frequency}
The eventual choice of sideband frequency, used to control cavity lengths using techniques such as \gls{PDH} (see Section\,\ref{sec:pdh}), will depend on a number of factors both physical and technical. For the purpose of control simulations, however, the only requirement is that the sideband frequency is not resonant within the arm cavities, in order to act as a discriminant to allow for the control of the arm cavity lengths. In practice, this means the frequency offset from the carrier must be greater than the cavity's \gls{FWHM} (see Section\,\ref{sec:cavity-fom}). For control simulations the sideband frequency was chosen to be \SI{15}{\mega\hertz}.

\subsection{\label{sec:velocity-control}Simple control strategy}
Figure\,\ref{fig:simplified-speedmeter-layout-velocity} shows a simplified optical layout of the \SSMEXPT{} with the addition of a basic control loop. The main beam splitter (BS) splits the input field towards the two triangular arm cavities where they form counter-propagating modes. One mode from each arm cavity is coupled into the other via the inter-cavity mirror \MINT{}, and the other modes recombine at the main beam splitter. Here, and for the rest of this chapter, we will consider only the cavity mirrors, the beam splitter and \MINT{}, defined as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:simplified-speedmeter-layout-velocity}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-svg/50-simplified-speedmeter-layout-velocity.pdf}
  \caption[Simplified layout of the \SSMEXPT{} including a basic velocity feedback loop]{\label{fig:simplified-speedmeter-layout-velocity}Simplified \SSM{} layout including extraction of the BHD signal sensitive to the arm cavity differential mode, \LMINUS{}, and the sensing and feedback paths. Light from the input optics (not shown) is incident upon the main beam splitter. The triangular arm cavities are shown in the shaded grey area, and mirror \MINT{} couples light between them. The shaded green area shows the BHD extracting the signal from the main beam splitter's output port (see Section\,\ref{sec:bhd}). The sensing and feedback signal paths are described in detail in Section\,\ref{sec:velocity-control}.}
\end{figure}

As shown in Section\,\ref{sec:ssm-dofs}, the differential arm cavity length \LMINUS{} is an independent degree of freedom and so frequency-dependent changes lead to frequency-dependent signals at the output port. Motion of an arm cavity mirror imparts signal sidebands upon the counter-propagating modes. These modes have different optical path lengths to the beam splitter and so the signal at the output port contains the superposition of signals representing the mirror's displacement from different points in time, which is analogous to velocity. At dc frequencies the two modes at the output port contain the same displacement information and the velocity signal is therefore zero (for a more complete description of the \SSM{}'s behaviour, see, for example, Section\,IIb of \cite{Chen2003}). Motion of \MINT{} and BS imprints common phase changes on both counter-propagating modes and are not considered degrees of freedom for signals sensed at the output port.

The error signal (\emph{readout}) representing \LMINUS{} is sensed at the main beam splitter's output port by means of a balanced homodyne detector (\gls{BHD}, see Section\,\ref{sec:bhd}) \cite{Steinlechner2015}, as shown in the shaded \checkme{green} area in Figure\,\ref{fig:simplified-speedmeter-layout-velocity}. The frequency dependence of the phase quadrature signal at the output port $s_{\textrm{BHD}}$ is given by the following relationship, ignoring the effect of losses\footnote{A full treatment of the effect of loss is given in ref.\,\cite{Danilishin2015}.}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:asymdarmbhdresponse}
  s_{\textrm{BHD}} \left( \Omega \right) \propto \frac{\Omega}{ \left(\Omega^2 + \gamma_{\textrm{arm}}^2 \right)} L_{\left(-\right)},
\end{equation}
for angular frequency $\Omega$ and with arm cavity half-bandwidth $\gamma_{\textrm{arm}}$ defined to be:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_{\textrm{arm}} = \frac{c_{0} T_{\textrm{ITM}}}{4 L_{\textrm{RT}}},
\end{equation}
for speed of light $c_{0}$, arm cavity input test mass (\gls{ITM}) power transmissivity $T_{\textrm{ITM}}$ and arm cavity round-trip length $L_{\textrm{RT}}$.
   
Other terms in the response function dependent upon mirror mass, laser power and mechanical modes are not frequency dependent. Note that for $\Omega \ll \gamma_{\textrm{arm}}$ the response is proportional to frequency, vanishing towards dc, as described above and shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:bhd-response}.

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-bhd-response.pdf}
  \caption[The frequency response of the differential arm cavity degree of freedom to the balanced homodyne readout]{\label{fig:bhd-response}The frequency response of the BHD to \LMINUS{}, simulated numerically with \emph{Optickle}. As the BHD is sensitive to the \SSM{}'s velocity, the signal is proportional to frequency below the cavity pole, and thus zero at dc.}
\end{figure}

In order to maintain peak \gls{BHD} sensitivity to \LMINUS{} and therefore gravitational waves, the positions of the cavity mirrors are controlled using \emph{linear inverting feedback}, where an error signal is extracted and applied through a control law to cavity mirror actuators. In the experiment, voice coils and plate capacitor electrostatic drives (\glspl{ESD}, see \cite{Wittel2015} and Chapter\,\ref{c:esd-concept}) are used to actuate on the position of the end test masses within each cavity. This feedback maintains the interferometer close to its operating point within the bandwidth of the controller.

\subsection{\label{sec:ssm-required-control}Required controller precision}

In order to achieve the required stability, the relative position of the cavity mirrors must be held close to the top of the interference fringe formed by the resonant light. The noise present within the interferometer, however, produces an unintended \emph{dark-fringe offset} at the output port of the \SSM{}. The dark fringe condition is only met when there is no interferometer noise, though the slope of the fringe near the minimum is shallow within about 1\% of the fringe's \gls{FWHM}. A thorough analysis of the required control precision has been derived for the case of a \DRFPMI{} with \gls{DC} readout \cite{Vajente2011} but to the author's knowledge this has not been repeated for a \SSM{} with \gls{BHD} readout. As most technical noise sources in the \SSM{} have similar output port couplings to that of a \MI{}, the requirement is expected to be similar. Assuming that the frequency fluctuations $\Delta f$ fall within \SI{1}{\percent} of the arm cavity \gls{FWHM}, we can derive a requirement to ensure that technical noise sources do not couple strongly to the gravitational wave channel.

Using the parameters listed in Table\,\ref{tab:parameters} with the relation linking laser frequency fluctuations $\Delta f$ and cavity length fluctuations $\Delta L_{\left(-\right)}$,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta L_{\left(-\right)}}{L_{\textrm{RT}}} = \frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}},
\end{equation}
with $f_{0} = \frac{c_{0}}{\lambda_{0}}$ representing the laser frequency, the requirement for the \SSMEXPT{} is that the residual displacement of the mirrors due to noise must be less than \SI{3.5e-13}{\meter}.

As shown in ref. \cite{Danilishin2015}, asymmetries in the main beam splitter introduce common arm cavity mode coupling at the output port, which leads to further unintended dark fringe offset, and so the real requirement is likely to be more stringent. The controller should therefore have a large factor of safety in terms of the gain it is able to apply to the system to hold it at the operating point.

\subsection{\label{sec:bhd}Balanced homodyne detection}
     
The \gls{BHD} at the \SSMEXPT{}'s output port consists of two high quantum-efficiency photodetectors sensing the reflected and transmitted fields from the \gls{BHD}'s beam splitter. A local oscillator is incident upon the \gls{BHD}'s beam splitter to provide gain for the velocity information encoded within the light from the main beam splitter, itself incident at another port of the \gls{BHD}'s beam splitter. The difference current is converted to a voltage by an op-amp with transimpedance resistor \RT{} before being sent to the data acquisition system (\gls{DAQ}). The transimpedance resistor was set to \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} to balance the op-amp's current and voltage noise contributions at its output.

An example circuit for the balanced homodyne detector is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:bhd-electronics}. The op-amp introduces its own noise to the output, though a well-chosen op-amp will possess noise significantly lower than the signal representing \LMINUS{} in the intended measurement band. In order for an op-amp to contribute less than \SI{1}{\percent} of the uncorrelated noise in the measurement, its noise must be at least a factor of \SI{10}{} below the dominating noise source in the measurement band.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-tikz/50-bhd-electronics.pdf}
  \caption[Electronic schematic for the balanced homodyne readout]{\label{fig:bhd-electronics}Simplified electronic schematic for the BHD readout. The difference current from two matched, high quantum efficiency photodiodes is amplified via a transimpedance op-amp stage, with this signal representing the differential motion of the arm cavity mirrors (see Equation\,\ref{eq:asymdarmbhdresponse}).}
\end{figure}

Op-amps used for control in audio-band interferometry typically possess a noise power spectrum inversely proportional to frequency (so-called \emph{flicker noise} \cite[Section\,11.2.3]{Gray2009}) in the low audio band. As the \gls{BHD} error signal is dependent upon the time derivative of the mirror positions, however, there will necessarily be frequencies at which the op-amp noise will dominate the \gls{BHD} error signal. This makes control of slow drifts of the arm cavity mirror positions impossible with the velocity readout, despite the op-amp being well-chosen for a measurement band above \SI{100}{\hertz}. This control problem with relation to the \SSMEXPT{} will be quantified in the following subsections.

\subsection{\label{sec:op-amp-noise}Op-amp noise}
To measure the effect of a suitable op-amp's noise at low frequencies, the output from an applicable \gls{BHD} circuit was investigated. The circuit shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:bhd-noise-electronics} was housed within a dark enclosure to minimise photocurrent, with one of the two op-amps within a Texas Instruments\textsuperscript{\textregistered} OPA2227 integrated circuit being used to amplify the noise from the other by a factor of \SI{100}{}. This amplification step is necessary in order to allow the desired op-amp noise to be measured above the noise of the \gls{CDS} analogue-to-digital converters used to record the data. The OPA2227 op-amp is a low-noise precision amplifier designed for audio applications, and is thus suitable for the \gls{BHD} readout in the \SSMEXPT{} depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:bhd-electronics} given the intended measurement band around a few hundreds of \SI{}{\hertz}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-tikz/50-bhd-noise-electronics.pdf}
  \caption[Electronic schematic for the measurement of noise from the balanced homodyne readout]{\label{fig:bhd-noise-electronics}Electronic schematic for the measurement of noise from the BHD readout circuit shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:bhd-electronics}. The output from the transimpedance op-amp is multiplied by a factor of \num{100} by an identical op-amp. The level of multiplication was chosen to allow this noise to exceed the noise of the ADCs on CDS.}
\end{figure}

The noise measurements were recorded for a period of \SI{16}{} days alongside an open DAQ input channel used to quantify some of the measurement noise. The time series is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:op-amp-noise-time-series}, where a drift over the course of the measurements is apparent. A Fourier transform of the measured op-amp noise time series (Figure\,\ref{fig:op-amp-noise-spectrum}) shows a combination of flicker noise and an additional slope possibly due to resistor current noise below around \SI{1}{\hertz} \cite{Seifert2009}. DAQ noise dominates above \SI{4}{\hertz}. The ``Model (total)'' spectral density in Figure\,\ref{fig:op-amp-noise-spectrum} show the contributions to the measurements from the first op-amp $\textrm{N}_{1}$'s current and voltage noise and the Johnson-Nyquist noise of its transimpedance resistor $\textrm{R}_{\textrm{T}}$. This spectral density additionally contains the measured open channel noise summed in quadrature to show the agreement it has with the measurements down to around \SI{1}{\hertz}.

The op-amp noise (\checkme{blue}) drifts from \num{0} to a level of approximately \SI{-7.3}{\milli\volt} over the 16 days of measurements. Simultaneously, a DAQ channel was measured without an input connected (\checkme{blue}) in order to act as a null stream. The temperature was also measured by a sensor within the same housing as the noise circuit (\checkme{orange}), showing a drift of around \SI{0.5}{\celsius}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-op-amp-noise-spectrum.pdf}
  \caption[Spectral density of the noise measured from the balanced homodyne readout electronics]{\label{fig:op-amp-noise-spectrum}Spectral density of the noise measured from the BHD readout electronics. The op-amp noise spectrum (\checkme{blue}) shows the data in Figure\,\ref{fig:op-amp-noise-time-series} plotted in the frequency domain using a Fourier transform with \SI{e4}{\second} windows. The DAQ noise spectra is also given (\checkme{blue}) along with modelled op-amp and resistor noise sources projected into the same measurement point (\checkme{green and orange}). The most significant contribution to the output is from the first op-amp, as per design, though the noise model, which considers input voltage and current noise, departs from the measurements at lower frequencies.}
\end{figure}

The op-amp noise drift produces an offset upon the \gls{BHD} error signal which is to be fed back to the cavity mirror actuators, and thus op-amp noise directly contributes to cavity mirror displacement noise, affecting the experiment's sensitivity to the arm cavity differential mode. Since the signal measured at the \gls{BHD} represents cavity mirror velocity, it must necessarily drop below the noise at low frequencies where the velocity tends to zero.

\subsection{Technical noise}

\subsubsection{Analogue to digital converters}
The conversion of analogue signals to digital by \gls{CDS} for control and acquisition purposes involves the use of \glspl{ADC}. Noise in an \gls{ADC} arises from \emph{quantisation error} $\epsilon_{\text{ADC}}$, which is the mismatch between the underlying signal input and the level determined by the \gls{ADC} \cite{Allen1997}. An \gls{ADC}'s job is to take an analogue signal of some voltage and convert it into a corresponding binary word proportional to that input. The fastest \glspl{ADC} work by splitting the input signal into copies and comparing each copy against an increasing threshold voltage\footnote{This is called a ``parallel'' \gls{ADC}, though there exist many other forms such as ``successive approximation'', ``voltage-to-frequency'', ``integration'' and ``delta-sigma''. A good overview is given in \cite{Horowitz2015}.}. Initially ignoring additional technical complexity, we can imagine the thresholds of the \gls{ADC} to represent bits of a binary word. The first threshold will check if the input is above or below \SI{1}{\volt}, and output a corresponding high or low signal at that bit location. Subsequent thresholds check for \SI{2}{\volt}, \SI{4}{\volt} and so on. With this simple picture the most obvious flaw is that this system can only determine integer voltage levels, and so the quantisation error is \SI{0.5}{\volt}. In reality, however, input signals are typically stationary random processes and oscillate between thresholds; in effect they are self-dithered. By averaging over successive cycles, the \gls{ADC} can make a better approximation of the underlying signal, reducing the quantisation error to the interval $\epsilon_{\text{ADC}} \in \left( \frac{-\Delta}{2}, \frac{\Delta}{2} \right]$ \cite{Allen1997}, where $\Delta$ is the smallest representable voltage level of an \gls{ADC} of $b$ bits:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta &= \frac{V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}}{2^{b}} \\
           &= \frac{V_{\text{range}}}{2^{b}}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Quantisation noise depends on the noise produced by the components that make up an \gls{ADC}'s threshold sensors, with each contributing noise from its electronics to the output. In the case of \gls{CDS}, the effective number of bits\footnote{One might decide to purchase an \gls{ADC} based merely upon its number of bits, but this is not a good guide for determining its sensitivity. A 24-bit \gls{ADC} is no better than a 16-bit \gls{ADC} if the first 8 bits are noise. A more useful figure of merit is the \gls{ENOB}.} (\gls{ENOB}) is $b = 13.9$, corresponding to a noise level of \SI{1.8e-6}{\volt\per\sqrthz} using the relation:
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_{\text{ADC}} = \frac{V_{\text{range}}}{2^b \sqrt{12 f_{N}}},
\end{equation}
where $f_{N}$ is the Nyquist frequency. This noise floor is flat across much of the bandwidth of \gls{CDS}, as it is determined by the noise of op-amps chosen for low noise in the audio band.

\subsubsection{Digital to analogue converters}
From the digital to the analogue domain, the same process happens in reverse with \glspl{DAC}. This time, quantisation noise arises directly from the inability of the \gls{DAC} to faithfully reconstruct the digital signal without adding noise, which is effectively a series of summed voltage thresholds in a similar arrangement to that of an \gls{ADC}. With the \gls{CDS} system, the \glspl{ADC} and \glspl{DAC} are well matched and both possess the same noise floor.

\subsection{Sensing and actuation dynamic range considerations}

\subsubsection{Whitening and dewhitening filters}
The signals sensed by the interferometer's photodetectors contain large components at low frequencies arising from seismic noise, and small components at higher frequencies where the measurement of radiation pressure and shot noise can be made. The \gls{ADC}'s input range of \SI{\pm10}{\volt} and its noise \SI{1.8e-6}{\volt\per\sqrthz} lead to a dynamic range $\text{D}$ of:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \text{D} &= 20 \log_{10} \left( \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{\epsilon_{\text{ADC}}} \right) \\
             &= \SI{134.9}{\deci\bel}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Well chosen signal amplification should result in an \gls{RMS} signal of less than $\frac{1}{10} V_{\text{max}}$, giving headroom to the sensors for larger, less frequent noise transients to be detected without clipping while still allowing small signal detection. As the signal from the interferometer is shaped \checkme{approximately inversely to frequency}, signals in the \SI{}{\kilo\hertz} band are typically many orders of magnitude smaller than those of seismic noise at a few \SI{}{\hertz}, meaning that signals at the level of quantum noise are sometimes lost in the noise from the \glspl{ADC} and \glspl{DAC}. To avoid this problem, a technique called \emph{whitening} can be used. This involves applying a filter to the desired input or output signal in order to increase certain frequency components of a signal.

The effect of whitening is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:whitening} for a hypothetical signal and sensor. In the left case, the signal's dynamic range is greater than that of the sensor, and so the sensor is unable to measure the signal with fidelity. At higher frequencies, the signal is below the level of the sensor's noise and as such the sensor measures no signal there. Most noise sources in gravitational wave interferometry have, however, some inverse frequency dependence at the main interferometer readout such that the signal content at higher frequencies is smaller than the signal content at lower frequencies. By applying a whitening filter at higher frequencies, the small signal content there can be enhanced to a level at which it can be detected by the sensor above its noise. This effectively reduces the dynamic range of the signal. This is shown in the right case. The original signal can be recovered digitally by the application of an inverse whitening filter.

The use of whitening can lead to extra noise at higher frequencies, where the continually decaying signal becomes lower than the electronic noise of any real whitening filter arising from the op-amps and resistors. Care must be taken in the design of whitening filters, with components chosen fit for the intended measurement band.

The sensor will in this circumstance be insensitive to signals at frequencies greater than around \SI{80}{\hertz}, assuming that the signal continues to decrease inversely to frequency (as is typical for noise sources in gravitational wave interferometry), instead reading only the noise of the sensor (at $\text{SNR} = 0$). In the right diagram, the signal has had a whitening filter applied to it to increase the signal's magnitude at higher frequencies and thus make it detectable within the dynamic range of the sensor. The underlying, unwhitened signal can be recovered digitally by the application of the inverse whitening filter.}

\subsubsection{Aliasing and imaging}

A consequence of the Nyquist sampling theorem is that \gls{AC} signal content can be exactly reconstructed by a sampler if and only if the signal power above the Nyquist frequency is zero. Non-zero signal at frequencies $f > f_{\text{N}}$ will enter the band of the sampler every \checkme{$\frac{f}{f_{\text{N}}}$} cycles and appear on top of the real signal content in that band. To prevent this occurrence, anti-aliasing filters can be utilised to aggressively suppress higher frequency content using analogue electronics before the signal is sampled by the \gls{ADC}. Similarly, the output from a \gls{DAC} can be propagated through an anti-imaging filter to prevent the \gls{DAC}'s finite sample rate from creating higher frequency copies of in-band signal content.

With \gls{CDS}, the sample rate is \SI{65536}{\hertz}, and so the Nyquist frequency is \SI{32768}{\hertz}, and the anti-aliasing and anti-imaging filters have cut-off frequency \SI{9}{\kilo\hertz} to ensure that frequency content near the Nyquist frequency is practically zero. Figure\,\ref{fig:aa-ai-filter-tfs} shows the (identical) transfer functions of the anti-aliasing and anti-imaging filters implemented in \gls{CDS}. At the sample frequency, the input signals are attenuated by a factor of around \SI{e5}{}, preventing almost all aliasing

At the sample frequency, a notch filter removes all but a factor of \SI{e-5}{} of the signal to prevent signal at frequencies beyond the sample frequency from aliasing or imaging into the lower range.}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:sus-gain-hierarchy}Suspension gain hierarchy}

As discussed in \note{Chapter 4...} the suspensions for the \glspl{ETM} will contain two actuators: voice coils, for control of the test mass motion at low frequencies where seismic noise is significant; and an \gls{ESD} for control at high frequencies to correct small but fast perturbations.

The feedback signal generated by the controller within the loop is a signal with frequency components at low and high frequencies, and a set of filters is required to split this feedback between the voice coils and the \glspl{ESD} in what is termed a \emph{gain hierarchy}.

As the \gls{ESD} is expected to have excellent noise performance (see Chapter\,\ref{c:esd-concept}), it would ideally be used for test mass positional corrections across the entire control bandwidth; its maximum force output, however, is limited and is nowhere near capable of controlling the test masses due to seismic noise at low frequencies. The \gls{RMS} motion of the uncontrolled \glspl{ETM} is approximately \SI{e-6}{\meter} due to noise sources such a seismic, thermal, electronic and quantum, while the maximum force output of the \gls{ESD} is around \SI{250}{\nano\newton}, corresponding to a displacement of around \SI{1.2e-7}{\meter} at \SI{1}{\hertz}. The response of the \gls{ESD} at high frequencies is what would be expected of a force to displacement coupling, proportional to $\frac{1}{f^2}$. The voice coils' response, however, is contains both a $\frac{1}{f^2}$ response from force to displacement of the intermediate stage, as well as an additional $\frac{1}{f^2}$ term from the additional pendulum stage between the intermediate mass and the test mass, giving an overall filtering effect proportional to $\frac{1}{f^4}$. We therefore want to focus the \gls{ESD}'s effort at high frequencies where its response is strongest, while using the coils at low frequencies where the vastly increased range is available to correct for larger noise disturbances.
% Claim about rms motion of uncontrolled ETM: run /speedmeter/trunk/IfoSimulations/Optickle/projects/noise-budget/plotDiffNoiseBudget.m with large frequency range (e.g. logspace(-2, 5, 1000)), and comment out the line that overrides the rms calculation in the source code
% Maximum ESD force is 250 nN, from https://arran.physics.gla.ac.uk/wp/speedmeter/?p=4507. This is multiplied by the force-to-displacement transfer function of the ETM ESD, calculated with Simulink. Use the 1 Hz number, 0.459 m/N.

In order to create the gain hierarchy a series of filters were implemented around a state-space model of the \gls{ETM} suspension. This model includes the response of the actuators from force to displacement for each degree of freedom of the interferometer. The use of filters on the input path to each actuator allows us to split the feedback signal into low- and high-frequency corrections, while an overall filter allows corrections to be applied to both actuators for features common to both actuators. The suspension gain hierarchy is depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:simulink-etm-control-loop}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{graphics/50-simulink-etm-control-loop.png}
  \caption[End test mass suspension control loop block diagram]{\label{fig:simulink-etm-control-loop}ETM suspension control loop block diagram. The output of the state-space model representing the test mass motion is fed back to the actuators via an ``overall'' servo. While this can in principle represent the interferometer's response, since the test mass motion from the suspension will be altered by the interferometer before being fed back to the actuators, in the development of the gain hierarchy the interferometer's response is assumed to be unity. The real effects can be compensated for in the controller (see Section\,\ref{sec:ifo-compensation}). \note{The input signal is first passed through a filter...}}
\end{figure}

From the control precision requirement presented in Section\,\ref{sec:ssm-required-control} it can be shown that the \gls{RMS} motion as a function of frequency drops below this requirement around \SI{100}{\hertz}, meaning that the interferometer's controller must at least feed back signals until this frequency. To give the controller some extra headroom to control particularly large noise transients\textemdash expected due to the stationary random noise present within the system\textemdash the unity gain frequency should instead be set at a higher frequency.

While the shaping of the hierarchical gain is an iterative process that requires some trial and error, the following paragraphs attempt to explain the process in the context of the \SSMEXPT{} in a logical order.

\paragraph{Stable unity gain frequency}
Assuming the control bandwidth is to be \SI{350}{\hertz}, the first requirement of the \gls{ESD} feedback is that its slope should be proportional to $\frac{1}{f}$ at \SI{350}{\hertz} to facilitate a stable unity gain crossing. A transitional differentiator between \SI{30}{\hertz} and \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} provides this slope.

\paragraph{Dynamic range considerations}
The next requirement is set by the dynamic range of the \gls{ESD}: if the unity gain frequency is to be \SI{350}{\hertz}, the feedback cannot be provided at too low a frequency where its finite range would be consumed by the correction of large noise perturbations. We boost the voice coils' gain at low frequencies with a transitional integrator between \SI{0.01}{\hertz} and \SI{1}{\hertz}, near the suspension's longitudinal pendulum resonance, and reduce the \gls{ESD}'s feedback with a transitional differentiator between \SI{0.05}{\hertz} and \SI{5}{\hertz}.

\paragraph{Stable actuator crossover frequency}
The frequency at which the magnitude of feedback from the voice coils and \gls{ESD} is equal is called the \emph{crossover}. This point has the same requirement as the unity gain frequency, in that the feedback must not be \SI{180}{\degree} out of phase with the input (see Section\,\ref{sec:gain-phase-margin}). To facilitate a stable crossover at around \SI{18}{\hertz}\textemdash chosen to prevent the \gls{ESD}'s range from being consumed by low frequency noise\textemdash a transitional differentiator between \SI{2}{\hertz} and \SI{50}{\hertz} was added to the voice coil servo to provide necessary phase margin between the actuator feedback signals.

\paragraph{Increasing the voice coil feedback at the pendulum resonances}
At \SI{1.8}{\hertz} the final pendulum stage is resonant and so the ground motion is amplified instead of suppressed. To keep this motion under control an additional boost was provided to the voice coil feedback through a resonant gain filter: a \nth{2} order resonant gain filter (Scultete type) with pole and zero at the resonant frequency, with a quality factor of around \num{3} to allow for slight changes in the resonant frequency due to temperature drift and cross-couplings.

\paragraph{Control of pitch coupling}
At \SI{10.2}{\hertz}, a coupling between pitch and longitudinal modes of the suspension's final stage pendulum leads to a suspension resonant gain. To prevent this mode from ringing, a \nth{2} order resonant gain filter was applied at \SI{10.2}{\hertz} with a quality factor of \num{4} to allow for manufacturing tolerance. As the voice coil and \gls{ESD} feedback is of similar magnitude at this frequency, this filter was placed within the common feedback path.

\paragraph{Damping of violin modes}
Violin modes (see Section\,\ref{sec:sus-thermal-noise}) are present on the \gls{ETM} suspensions starting at \SI{800}{\hertz}. Although this frequency is well above the control bandwidth, the modes have high enough quality factor and amplitude and are resonant peaks with a \SI{180}{\degree} phase change such that they can potentially lead to positive (unstable) feedback. Instead of damping these modes with resonant gain, we avoid feedback at this frequency by applying a \nth{2} order notch filter. The second violin mode is at a high enough frequency that its amplitude does not cross unity gain and therefore does not affect the stability of the loop.

  \caption[Simulated end test mass suspension actuator open loop transfer functions]{\label{fig:suspension-crossover}Simulated \SSMEXPT{} ETM suspension actuator open-loop transfer functions showing the difference in gain between the voice coils and ESD. The voice coils provide extensive actuation range but are suppressed at high frequencies by the final stage pendulum. The \gls{ESD} actuates directly upon the test mass and is therefore capable of providing stronger correction than the voice coils at higher frequencies. A \nth{2} order notch filter is present on both actuators at \SI{800}{\hertz} to prevent excitation of the first suspension violin mode.}
\end{figure}

The open-loop transfer functions for the voice coils and \gls{ESD} are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:suspension-crossover}.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:ifo-compensation}Interferometer compensation}
The suspension gain hierarchy in Section\,\ref{sec:sus-gain-hierarchy} was developed by feeding the test mass motion directly back to the suspension actuators (as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:simulink-etm-control-loop}). In reality, the test mass motion changes the signal on the \gls{BHD} and so the frequency components of the signal are altered. In order for the suspension gain hierarchy to operate as designed, a filter must be placed in the controller to compensate for the interferometer's response. This was implemented in \gls{CDS} as transitional integrators: the first between \SI{0.1}{\hertz} and \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz} and the second between \SI{1}{\hertz} and \SI{100}{\hertz}. While these filters do not reproduce the exact response of the interferometer, it approximates it closely enough such that the suspension gain hierarchy can operate as per its design. During commissioning it will be useful to adjust the shape of the interferometer compensation to improve the controller's performance.

\subsubsection{Photodiode quantum efficiency}
A real photodiode cannot fully convert incoming light power into photocurrent without some loss. The current produced for a given incident light power is related to the photodiode's \emph{quantum efficiency}, and for \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} laser light there exists some high quantum efficiency models providing upwards of \SI{0.95}{\ampere\per\watt}. For the \gls{BHD} readout, Fermionics photodiodes are to be used, providing a response in excess of \SI{0.9}{\ampere\per\watt}.

\subsubsection{Loop gain}
With the response of \LMINUS{} to the \gls{BHD} readout implemented in the control loop alongside the suspension feedback and interferometer compensation filters, the strength of the control loop's suppression of displacement noise is determined by the \emph{loop} gain. This is a dimensionless number determined in by the response of each component within the loop into its connected components. It can be increased manually through the use of a \gls{DC} gain stage placed anywhere within the loop, or for instance by utilising a photodetector with higher quantum efficiency or by using stronger actuators. It is in practice easiest to place a manual gain stage within the controller, in this case the \gls{CDS} system where gain is ``free'' within the limit of the voltage range of the \gls{DAC}. An increase in the loop's \gls{DC} gain leads to a higher open loop unity gain frequency and this means the feedback at lower frequencies will be stronger, with seismic noise being more aggressively suppressed. The residual displacement of the test masses will decrease with higher loop gain, leading to better control, until the \gls{RMS} range of an actuator or sensor is reached. A rule of thumb with the operation of control loops within the field of gravitational wave interferometry is to keep the phase margin at the unity gain frequency greater than around \SI{35}{\degree} \cite{Freise2003}.

\section{Velocity control}

\subsection{Control loop}

A control loop schematic using the calculations, filters and servos presented in Section\,\ref{sec:ssm-control} is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-control-loop-velocity}. The items contained within the grey box are implemented in software as part of the LIGO control and data system \cite{Bork2010}. The lower section contains the blocks which exist in the analogue domain.

  \caption[Modelled \SSMEXPT{} control loop using velocity feedback]{\label{fig:ssm-control-loop-velocity}Simple \SSM{} control loop model. The interferometer plant produces signals representing the probes in the interferometer, and sensing noise is added before the signals are sent to the digital controller, shown in the grey box. Within the controller, the error signal representing \LMINUS{} is fed through a series of filters and sent to the test mass actuators, with the addition of DAC noise. The suspension blocks transform the feedback signals into test mass displacements, and seismic, coating Brownian and suspension thermal noise is injected at the input to the interferometer plant. The grey box at the top denotes the noise, servo and gain blocks associated with CDS. \note{ADD AI FILTERS}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{sec:noise-projection}Noise projection with velocity feedback}

To reach the desired sensitivity of the interferometer it is crucial to understand the noise characteristics associated with the sensing and control apparatus employed in the experiment. Individual noise sources, for example arising from the \gls{BHD} op-amp electronics, can be projected into units of differential displacement-equivalent noise using the linear projection technique \cite{Smith2006}. The sources of noise can be logically separated into two broad categories: \emph{sensing noise} and \emph{displacement noise}. Both sources of noise are fed back to the test masses because in practice it is not possible for the controller to distinguish them.

Sources of sensing noise are associated with the readout of the variable of interest\textemdash in the case of the \SSM{} the positions of the test masses' surfaces\textemdash but do not directly influence the variable of interest in an open loop measurement. Sources of sensing noise include quantum shot noise, electronic noise including op-amp noise as modelled in Section\,\ref{sec:op-amp-noise} and digitisation noise due to the analogue-to-digital converter (\gls{ADC}).

Displacement noise sources directly influence the positions of the test mass surfaces being measured by the interferometer and are therefore transformed by the dynamics of the test masses \cite{Danilishin2015}. As the readout variable in the \gls{BHD} is the time derivative of position, the control system measures and actively suppresses these noise sources. Significant sources of displacement noise in the \SSM{} experiment are quantum radiation pressure noise, seismic noise, suspension thermal noise \cite{Hammond2012} and coating brownian noise arising from the dielectric coatings present upon the cavity mirrors \cite{Harry2002}.

The noise projection for \LMINUS{}, calculated using the numerical optomechanical simulation tool \emph{Optickle} \cite{Evans2012} (see Appendix\,\ref{sec:optickle-sim}) and the control noise modelling tool \emph{SimulinkNb} \cite{SimulinkNb}, is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-velocity}. The root-mean-square (\gls{RMS}) differential displacement this creates is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-velocity-rms} as a function of time. It shows that, as the interferometer is held at its operating point, over a period of several hours the expected drift is large enough for the cavities to become uncontrollable (see Appendix\,\ref{sec:ssm-required-control}).

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-readout-noise-velocity.pdf}

The significant noise sources associated with sensing shown (shot, op-amp and ADC noise). The noise directly actuating upon the test masses, such as seismic, are given the designation ``feedback''. Lab measurements of seismic noise have been made down to \SI{0.3}{\hertz}, and the assumption has been made that the noise is sharply suppressed below the microseism at \SI{0.1}{\hertz}. Below \SI{20}{\milli\hertz} the dominating readout noise is due to the op-amp electronics.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-readout-noise-velocity-rms.pdf}
  \caption[Root-mean-square noise projection for \LMINUS{} using velocity feedback]{\label{fig:readout-noise-velocity-rms}Root-mean-square noise projection for \LMINUS{} using velocity feedback. The requirement is exceeded beyond a few hours, after which the noise due to the BHD readout is enough for the cavities to drift beyond the displacement requirement and lose sensitivity.}
\end{figure}

Although for sensing noise we only consider electronic and shot noise, in the experiment there will be other contributing forms of time-varying offset present upon the \gls{BHD} error signal:
\begin{itemize}
  \item residual local oscillator light due to temperature-driven imbalances in the \gls{BHD} beam splitting ratio and photodetector quantum efficiencies;
  \item common mode arm cavity motion due to imbalanced beam splitting at the main beam splitter \cite{Danilishin2015};
  \item thermoelectric potentials and op-amp drift in pre-amplifier and whitening electronics;
  \item any other time-varying effects.
\end{itemize}
As such, the estimated rms displacement shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-velocity-rms} represents a ``best case'' scenario where the op-amp's electronic noise is the dominant effect at low frequencies, and this drift becomes unacceptably large after a few hours. To allow for long term cavity stability it is essential for the error signal to contain a signal significantly above the electronic noise at low frequencies. In the next section we present a strategy for obtaining an error signal of suitable magnitude across the entire control bandwidth.
 
\section{\label{sec:mixed-control}Velocity-displacement control}
   
Light from each counter-propagating mode is incident upon the inter-cavity steering mirror \MINT{}, and as such this is a natural port in which to separate the modes and sense the motion of each arm cavity (see the shaded blue region of Figure\,\ref{fig:simplified-speedmeter-layout-mixed}). Using RF modulation, for instance \emph{via} the Pound-Drever-Hall (\gls{PDH}) technique \cite{Drever1983}, it is possible to obtain a displacement error signal for each cavity that, unlike the velocity signal from the \gls{BHD}, has flat response at \gls{DC}, with a similar cavity pole frequency (see Figure\,\ref{fig:pdh-response}). The individual cavity \gls{PDH} signals can be mixed to obtain a measurement of \LMINUS{}, and the frequency dependence of the signal $s_{\textrm{PDH}}$ is, following ref.\,\cite{Kimble2001}, given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:m9darmpdhresponse}
  s_{\textrm{PDH}} \left( \Omega \right) \propto \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{\textrm{arm}}}{\left(\Omega^2 + \gamma_{\textrm{arm}}^2 \right)}} L_{\left(-\right)},
\end{equation}
ignoring again the effect of losses and constant terms as with Equation \ref{eq:asymdarmbhdresponse}. Note that for $\Omega \ll \gamma_{\textrm{arm}}$, the response is flat as expected for a displacement measurement and as such the PDH readout offers a suitable signal to sense \LMINUS{} at low frequencies.

\subsection{\label{sec:combined-filter}Combined filter}

The separate velocity and displacement readouts contain the same fundamental information about the position of the mirrors, albeit with different response functions. We can express the signal at output field $i$ as a function of the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ mode of motion, $\hat{o}_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( \Omega \right)$, as \cite{Kimble2001}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:readout-signals}
  \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( \Omega \right) = L_{\textrm{k}}\left(\Omega\right) + \frac{\hat{n}_{\textrm{i}} \left( \Omega \right)}{R_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( \Omega \right)}
\end{equation}
where $L_{\textrm{k}}$ is the position of mode $k$, $\hat{n}_{\textrm{i}} \left( \Omega \right)$ is the noise at field $i$ and $R_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( \Omega \right)$ is the optomechanical transfer function of mode $k$ to field $i$. The definition of a field in this case refers to that of a single signal sideband, $\Omega$. The total time domain signal on a perfect sensor due to the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ mode at the location of the output field will see a combination of the upper and lower signal sidebands:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( t \right) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\textrm{d} \Omega}{2 \pi} \left( \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,i}} \left( \omega_{0} + \Omega \right) + \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,i}}^\dag \left( \omega_{0} - \Omega \right) \right) e^{-i \Omega t},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{0}$ is the angular frequency of the carrier.

Classical noise sources associated with the test mass modes, such as thermal and seismic noise, are implicit in $L$. The excess noise at each readout port is therefore due to $\hat{n}_{\textrm{i}}$, the quantum vacuum entering at open ports within the interferometer. The presence of such vacuum noise limits the sensitivity of the interferometer in the measurement band. For this reason the reflectivity of \MINT{} must be chosen to be close to unity, therefore only a small amount of light is available to the displacement readout for use as a low frequency error signal.

By considering the response and noise characteristics of the \gls{BHD} and \gls{PDH} readouts it is possible to combine them with a filter in order to maximise the interferometer's sensitivity across the full intended frequency range. A desirable crossover frequency for this filter is constrained from below by the signal-to-noise ratio of the \gls{BHD} and from above by the noise introduced onto the feedback signal by the \gls{PDH} readout. There is a \SI{90}{\degree} phase difference between the displacement and velocity signals at low frequencies and as such simply combining the \gls{PDH} and \gls{BHD} signals with dc gain produces a filter with a stable crossover that can be used as an error signal. The feedback of this combined filter output allows the displacement signal from the \gls{PDH} to control the cavity mirrors at low frequencies where it is stronger, while letting the \gls{BHD} signal provide feedback at higher frequencies where it yields the greatest response. The optimal filter is discussed in the next section.

\subsection{\label{sec:optimal-filter}Optimal filter}
By considering cross-correlations in the quantum noise at the \gls{BHD} and \gls{PDH} readouts, it is possible to produce an optimal filter with which to combine the two in such a way as to minimise the total noise spectral density. The noise at each readout is the sum of the quantum noise inputs at open ports propagated through the interferometer with appropriate transfer functions, so we can rewrite $\hat{n}_{\textrm{i}}$ in Equation\,\ref{eq:readout-signals} in terms of the quantum noise amplitudes $\hat{q}_{\textrm{m}}$ entering at $N_{\textrm{p}}$ open ports:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{n}_{\textrm{i}} \left( \Omega \right) = \sum_{m=1}^{N_{\textrm{p}}} M^{\textrm{ff}}_{\textrm{m,i}}\left( \Omega \right) \hat{q}_{\textrm{m}} \left( \Omega \right),
\end{equation}
where $M^{\textrm{ff}}_{\textrm{m,i}}\left( \Omega \right)$ represents the transfer function between input field $m$ and output field $i$ for signal sideband $\Omega$. The cross-correlation spectral density for unity noise at the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ and $j^{\textrm{th}}$ output channels, for the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ mode, is then \cite{Danilishin2012}:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    S_{\textrm{k,\,ij}}(\Omega) = \sum_{m=1}^{N_{\textrm{p}}} \dfrac{\left[M^{\textrm{ff\,*}}_{\textrm{m,\,i}}(\Omega)M^{\textrm{ff}}_{\textrm{m,\,j}}(\Omega)+M^{\textrm{ff\,*}}_{\textrm{m,\,j}}(-\Omega)M^{\textrm{ff}}_{\textrm{m,\,i}}(-\Omega)\right]}{[R^*_{\textrm{k,\,i}}(\Omega)+R_{\textrm{k,\,i}}(-\Omega)][R_{\textrm{k,\,j}}(\Omega)+R^*_{\textrm{k,\,j}}(-\Omega)]}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
This reduces to the following form for noise entering the same port in which it exits:
\begin{equation}
  S_{i,i} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left| M^{\textrm{ff}}_{i,i}\left( \Omega \right) \right|^{2} + \left| M^{\textrm{ff}*}_{i,i}\left( -\Omega \right) \right|^{2}}{\left(\left| R^{ }_{k,i}\left( \Omega \right) \right| + \left| R^*_{k,i}\left(-\Omega\right)\right|\right)^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Assuming a filter $\alpha\left( \Omega \right)$ combines the BHD ($i = 1$) and PDH ($i = 2$) fields, its output for $L_{\textrm{k}}$ would be:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,combined}} \left( \Omega \right) &= \alpha\left( \Omega \right) \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,1}} \left( \Omega \right) + \left( 1 - \alpha\left( \Omega \right) \right) \hat{o}_{\textrm{k,2}} \left( \Omega \right) \\
    &= \left( \alpha\left( \Omega \right) L_{\textrm{k}} \left( \Omega \right) + \left(1 - \alpha\left( \Omega \right) \right) L_{\textrm{k}} \left( \Omega \right) \right) \\
    &+ \frac{\alpha\left( \Omega \right) \hat{n}_{\textrm{1}}}{R_{\textrm{k,1}}\left(\Omega\right)} + \frac{\left( 1 - \alpha\left( \Omega \right) \right) \hat{n}_{\textrm{2}}}{R_{\textrm{k,2}} \left(\Omega\right)}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}      
The corresponding total noise power spectral density of the combined readout is then:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:readout-spectral-density}
  \begin{split}
    S_{\textrm{readout}} &= \left| \alpha \right|^{2} S_{n_{1},n_{1}} + \left| 1 - \alpha \right|^{2} S_{n_{2},n_{2}} \\
    &+ \Re \left[ \alpha^* \left(1 - \alpha \right) S_{n_{1},n_{2}} \right] \\
    &+ \Re \left[ \alpha^* \left(1 - \alpha \right) S_{n_{2},n_{1}} \right],
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $S_{n_{1},n_{1}}$ is the noise power spectral density at the \gls{BHD} port due to vacuum entering at the \gls{BHD} port, $S_{n_{2},n_{2}}$ is the noise power spectral density at the \gls{PDH} port due to vacuum entering at the \gls{PDH} port, and $S_{n_{1},n_{2}}$ and $S_{n_{2},n_{1}}$ are the noise power spectral densities for noise entering at one port and exiting at the other. The optimal filter $\alpha_{\textrm{opt}}$ can be determined by minimising Equation\,\ref{eq:readout-spectral-density} over $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:optimal-filter}
  \alpha_{\textrm{opt}} = \frac{S_{n_{1},n_{2}} - S^*_{n_{1},n_{2}}}{S_{n_{1},n_{1}} + S_{n_{2},n_{2}} - \Re \left[ S_{n_{1},n_{2}} \right] - \Re \left[ S_{n_{2},n_{1}} \right]}.
\end{equation}
The reflectivity of \MINT{} is implicit in both the field-to-field and mode-to-field transfer matrices for each signal sideband, $\mathbf{M}^{\textrm{ff}}$ and $\mathbf{R}$, respectively, and as such $\alpha_{\textrm{opt}}$ depends on the value of \MINT{}.

The matrices $\mathbf{M}^{\textrm{ff}}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are not calculated in Optickle by default, and so some modifications to the code were necessary (see Appendix\,\ref{sec:optickle-field-tfs}). The effect of \MINT{}'s reflectivity on $\alpha_{\textrm{opt}}$ is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:optimal-filters}. Note that, because it is calculated with precomputed spectral densities and not tested for stability, the filter predicted by Equation\,\ref{eq:optimal-filter} is not necessarily realisable. A causal Wiener filter has previously been calculated for single-readout interferometers \cite{MuellerEbhardt2009, Miao2010}, but a similar calculation for more than one readout has not yet been investigated. While Equation\,\ref{eq:optimal-filter} enables the lowest noise spectral density for the measurement of the motion of the differential mode of the \SSM{}, in the case of the proof-of-concept experiment simply combining the \gls{BHD} and \gls{PDH} signals with \gls{DC} gain, as suggested in Section\,\ref{sec:combined-filter}, is close to optimal. The difference in response gradients above the cavity pole frequency prevents the \gls{PDH} signal from contaminating the \gls{QND} effect in the intended measurement band. The calculation presented in this section, however, is a general solution for any system with multiple readouts for a single variable and may prove useful for future gravitational wave detectors utilising \gls{QND} techniques.

The red, yellow and green curves are the coefficients to be applied to the BHD signal with respect to the PDH signal before the two are combined, for different \MINT{} (power) reflectivities. The black, dashed curve is the (unity) coefficient to be applied to the PDH signal. For all values of \MINT{} shown, the optimal combination involves suppressing the BHD signal with respect to the PDH at frequencies below around \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}; equivalently, the PDH signal must be amplified with respect to the BHD signal in the same band, an example of which is presented in Section\,\ref{sec:combined-filter}.}

\subsection{Control loop}
The intended control loop schematic for experiment with combined feedback is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-control-loop-mixed}. This is similar to the loop shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-control-loop-velocity}, though with the addition of signal paths from the interferometer's \gls{PDH} readout to the controller and two gain blocks to control the way in which the velocity and displacement readouts are combined. An additional step is modelled with the \gls{PDH} readout: the demodulation gain. This is the gain the signal receives as a result of the mixing of the sideband frequency as part of the \gls{PDH} technique. The responsivity of the photodiodes used for the \gls{PDH} readout has also been assumed smaller, at \SI{0.8}{\ampere\per\watt}, due to this channel's relaxed loss requirements.

This control loop is similar to that shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-control-loop-velocity}, but with the addition of components used to send the displacement-sensitive PDH readout to CDS. Within CDS, additional gain blocks allow for control over the way in which the velocity and displacement readouts are combined into one feedback signal.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Noise projection with combined feedback}
The differential displacement-equivalent noise projection for a simple combined filter as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:combined-filter} is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-mixed}. The \gls{RMS} displacement shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-mixed-rms} shows a clear reduction in residual displacement with respect to the feedback using only the velocity signal.

  \caption[Noise projection for \LMINUS{} using both displacement and velocity feedback]{\label{fig:readout-noise-mixed}Noise projection for \LMINUS{} using both displacement and velocity feedback. The mixing of displacement information into the feedback signal at low frequencies leads to greatly reduced overall displacement noise, as the noise from the velocity readout electronics is suppressed by the strong displacement response. As with Figure\,\ref{fig:readout-noise-velocity} some important individual contributions to the overall noise are shown.}

\end{figure}

The open loop gain of the controller is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:open-loop-gain}. This shows the unity gain frequency to be \SI{350}{\hertz}, with a phase margin of \SI{44}{\degree}. With this controller the system's differential arm cavity displacement is able to be controlled to within the requirement shown in Section\,\ref{sec:ssm-required-control}.

\subsection{\label{sec:noise-budget}Noise budget}

In order to show that quantum noise is reduced with respect to an equivalent \MI{}, the design of the \SSMEXPT{} intends for it to be the limiting noise source in a frequency band in the region of a few hundreds of \SI{}{\hertz} \cite{Graef2014}. Using the linear projection technique outlined in Section\,\ref{sec:noise-projection}, each anticipated significant source of noise has been estimated and projected into differential mode displacement-equivalent noise to discover the limiting sources across the control bandwidth, and verify that the experiment will be limited by quantum noise in the intended band. The noise budget was created in steps. First, the individual noise sources contributing to the displacement of the test masses and the sensing of the interferometer signals were estimated individually, as described in Section\,\ref{sec:ssm-control}. Each individual noise source was then projected to the point in the loop where the data is recorded\textemdash \gls{CDS}\textemdash with all other noise sources switched off. Here, the open loop gain of the controller was applied to simulate the effect the loop has in suppressing displacement noise sources. Finally, to understand the sensitivity in terms of differential arm cavity displacement, the noise spectral density was divided by the transfer function from cavity mirror motion to \gls{CDS}. The computed noise budget for each significant noise source is presented in Figure\,\ref{fig:noise-budget}. This budget is similar to the one presented in \cite{Graef2014}, with the difference that this noise budget is the product of a comprehensive control noise study. The noise contribution from the \gls{PDH} feedback is shown to be vastly lower than the limiting noise in the intended measurement band, justifying its inclusion.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/50-speedmeter-noise-budget.pdf}
  \caption[Control noise budget for the \SSMEXPT{}]{\label{fig:noise-budget}\SSM{} differential mode noise budget for the combined filter scheme with sensing and control noise taken into account. The shaded region represents the frequency band at which the intended direct measurement of reduced quantum radiation pressure noise is to be made in the experiment. The quantum noise contribution from the PDH readout is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the total quantum noise, showing that its inclusion in the combined filter is not harmful to the overall sensitivity in this band.}
\end{figure}

The sensitivity between \SI{100}{\hertz} and \SI{700}{\hertz}, shaded in \checkme{blue}, is the quantum noise limited measurement band. This band is constrained from below by test mass suspension mechanical mode cross-couplings (not shown) and from above by the first violin mode of the ETM suspensions. Suspension thermal noise is the second highest noise source present in this band and is at most a factor of \SI{2.3}{} below quantum noise, allowing a careful direct measurement of quantum radiation pressure noise to be made in this region. The contribution to the quantum noise from the PDH feedback is far below the limiting quantum noise, showing that the use of the displacement readout as part of the combined filter presented in Section\,\ref{sec:combined-filter} does not significantly affect the sensitivity of the \SSM{} in the desired band.

\section{\label{sec:summary}Summary}

We have demonstrated that positional drifts of the cavity mirrors in the proof-of-concept \SSM{} at low frequencies due to sensing noise lead to an inability to control the cavity mirrors over time scales longer than a few hours. We have shown that this drift can be suppressed by taking a small amount of light from the path between the arm cavities to provide a displacement readout, and that this does not significantly affect the sensitivity of the main, velocity readout. A combination of the displacement and velocity readouts provides a suitable error signal for the control of the arm cavity differential mode at all relevant frequencies without spoiling the quantum non-demolition effect at higher frequencies, facilitating measurements with arbitrary integration time and allowing the \SSM{} to reach its design sensitivity.

Since the main readout of any interferometer primarily sensitive to velocity will encounter the problem of vanishing signal in the presence of flat or increasing sensing noise at low frequencies, we believe the solution presented in this work is applicable to any audio-band speed-meter.
