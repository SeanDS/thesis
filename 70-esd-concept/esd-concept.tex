\chapter{Demonstration of a Plate Capacitor Electrostatic Drive Actuator}
\label{c:esd-concept}

* HV power supply design considerations (bleed resistor, voltage requirements, etc.)
* HV power supply current limiting circuit explanation (called ``foldback limiting'' - see H&H p694)
* HV amplifier design: pressure and temperature cut-offs (explanation of how it works), input/output signals, choice of connectors, routing of signals for ease of assembly (front panel disconnect, etc.)
* Protective earthing
* HV amplifier transfer function, usign both HV output (via voltage divider) and monitor output
* HV amplifier monitor noise measurement
