\chapter{Demonstration of a Plate Capacitor Electrostatic Drive Actuator}
\label{c:esd-concept}

* HV power supply design considerations (bleed resistor, voltage requirements, etc.)
* HV power supply current limiting circuit explanation (called ``foldback limiting'', see Horowitz and Hill p694)
* HV power supply heatsink considerations: power produced by MOSFETs at maximum current rating (100 mA, produces 25 W of heat - see datasheets) - chose heatsinks to dissipate this heat and make installation of the board easy (can screw TO-220 casing to L-shaped brackets)
* HV amplifier design: pressure and temperature cut-offs (explanation of how it works), input/output signals, choice of connectors, routing of signals for ease of assembly (front panel disconnect, etc.)
* Protective earthing
* HV amplifier transfer function, usign both HV output (via voltage divider) and monitor output
* HV amplifier monitor noise measurement
