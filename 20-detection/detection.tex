\chapter{Gravitational Wave Detection}
\label{c:gw-detection}

Blah blah blah

\section{Gravitational Waves as Predicted by General Relativity}
* Why do we care about GWs? See \href{https://github.com/rxa254/StatisticalPhysics/blob/master/LectureNotes/ph2c_2015.pdf}{Rana's lecture notes}  (Early universe section might be useful) 

\section{Brief History}
* Bar detectors
* First interferometric detectors:
  * Drever, Hough, Glasgow and Munich stuff
  * Glasgow 10m, Caltech 40m, Garching 30m, etc.
  * Formation of LIGO and GEO collaborations
  * Foundational papers (Weiss noise analysis, conference presentations from Schilling and Drever, etc.)
  * Meers paper on signal recycling
  * Initial LIGO, GEO-600, TAMA, Virgo, etc.
  * Enhanced LIGO (and Enhanced Virgo?)

\section{Overview of Current Efforts}
* Worldwide network of interferometric detectors
* Plans to build/upgrade more (KAGRA, ET, LIGO Voyager, LIGO CE, etc.)
* Space based detectors

\section{Limiting noise sources in future detectors}
Quantum noise, thermal noise (since if you push QN low enough, you run into thermal), possibly mention others (Newtonian noise - why ET will be under ground, etc.)

\section{Quantum Non-Demolition}
Give general overview of technique, then explain the Sagnac speedmeter in more detail.
