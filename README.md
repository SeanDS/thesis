# Sean Leavey's Thesis

Modified version of [Glasgow Thesis Template](https://github.com/sdstrowes/Glasgow-Thesis-Template) by Stephen D. Strowes, with some custom Make, BASH and Python hacks from me.

Follows the University of Glasgow style guide, as outlined in [this document](http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/library/enlighten/theses/thesispreparationguidelines.pdf).
