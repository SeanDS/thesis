\chapter{\label{c:speedmeter-intro}The \SSMEXPT{}: introduction and technical design}

\section{Concept}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Usual literature review: use 2nd year report, Living Review, Graef et al, etc...
  \item Show Michelson response and noise. This should be radiation pressure dominated below the pole. Relate this to the analytical response equation I used in the controls paper for a Michelson.
  \item Introduce Sagnac speedmeter, showing it has better quantum noise IN ABSENCE OF ASYMMETRIES, and thus better overall sensitivity for equivalent shot noise. DON'T SHOW THE SSM SENSITIVITY HERE.
  \item Use Stefan D's labbook entry for response functions: p5648
  \item Introduce losses to show the degrading effect they have, introducing ``Michelson-like'' sensitivity. The main thing to show here is the effect on the quantum noise when there are asymmetries, like test mass asymmetry. This broadens the peak around the suspension resonance, which introduces the Michelson-like sensitivity.
  \item Mention significance of M8/M9/M10's reflectivity (c.f. loss) which can be expanded later in the controls chapter.
  \item See S.D.'s talk at group meeting 6th July, talking about how speed meters need a pi phase shift between photons hitting the same mirror to cancel R.P. noise. In a Sagnac it is naturally occurring but in a Michelson it requires a sloshing cavity or polarisation optics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\label{sec:position-meter-measurement}Sensitivity of a position-meter}
In an ordinary \FPMI{} position-meter, the mirrors in each arm cavity are sampled by separate light beams which recombine at the beam splitter. Motion of each cavity in the longitudinal direction either shortens or elongates the round-trip phase of the light in each arm, and this motion is thus imprinted upon the \emph{phase} of the light returning to the beam splitter. The phase difference of the two recombining beams at the beam splitter then leads to light at the output port, which can be measured using a heterodyne or homodyne readout as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:readout}.

The presence of classical light power in the arms leads to a radiation pressure effect which imparts a force upon the test masses. A restoring force on the mirrors, either via a pendulum in a suspended experiment or a mirror mount on a table-top experiment, means that this force is static and the interferometer can be held at the operating point as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:operating-point} by microscopic \gls{DC} corrections.

\subsubsection{Input-output relations}
The signal that can be detected at the output port of a \FPMI{} can be calculated using \emph{input-output relations} defining the effect that some input signal would have on the output given the dynamics of the interferometer. In order to represent the effect that the interferometer has in terms of its effect on the amplitude and phase of the light, we use the \emph{two-photon formalism} \cite{Caves1985, Schumaker1985} which represents the input and output in terms of its \emph{cosine} and \emph{sine} quadratures, namely:
\begin{align}
  \vec{a} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a_c \\
    a_s
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  \vec{b} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    b_c \\
    b_s
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where $\vec{a}$ is the input field and $\vec{b}$ is the output field. The output for an interferometer held at the dark fringe can be expressed as \cite{Danilishin2015}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ifo-output-signal}
  \vec{b} = \vec{R} \frac{h}{h_{\text{SQL}}} + \mathbb{T} \vec{a},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{R}$ is the response of the interferometer from unit mirror motion to the output, $\frac{h}{h_{\text{SQL}}}$ is the motion of the mirrors in terms of strain normalised to the \gls{SQL} as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:sql} and $\mathbb{T}$ represents the transfer function of the input field to the output field.

The response $\vec{R}$ contains the effect that the mirror dynamics have on the readout, governed by the \emph{optomechanical coupling factor} $\kappa_{\text{MI}}$ defined for a \MI{} in Equation\,\ref{eq:optomechanicalcoupling}. This models the effect that an applied force to the mirror has on its position. Mirrors suspended from pendulum systems can be approximated at high frequencies to be a free mass, where the effect on position that an applied force has is diminished proportional to frequency, and in the case of a \FPMI{} this filtering effect scales as $\frac{1}{f^2}$ below the cavity's pole frequency, and $\frac{1}{f^4}$ above it.

The response to differential arm cavity motion, where the gravitational wave signal would appear, is given as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fp-mich-response}
  \vec{R}_{\left( - \right)} = \text{e}^{\text{i} \beta_{\text{FP}} \left( f \right)} \sqrt{2 \kappa_{\text{MI}}} \vec{H},
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{\text{FP}} \left( f \right)$ is the round-trip phase of the light in the arms and $\vec{H}$ represents the readout angle or \emph{quadrature}, $\zeta$:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{H} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos \zeta \\
    \sin \zeta
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The round-trip phase is defined:
\begin{equation}
  \beta_{\text{FP}} \left( f \right) = \arctan{\frac{f}{\gamma_{\text{arm}}}},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{\text{arm}}$ is the \FP{} cavity half-bandwidth (see Appendix\,\ref{sec:cavity-fom}).

In the case of \gls{DC} readout, as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:homodyne-readout} and used in current generation detectors, the readout angle $\zeta = \SI{90}{\degree}$ represents the phase quadrature:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{H} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

We can calculate the signal at the \gls{DC} readout of the \FPMI{}, $O$, as a function of differential arm cavity motion by rearranging Equation\,\ref{eq:ifo-output-signal}:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{O_{\text{dc}} \left( f \right)}{h_{\left( - \right)}} = \frac{\text{e}^{\text{i} \beta_{\text{FP}} \left( f \right)} \sqrt{2 \kappa_{\text{MI}}}}{h_{\text{SQL}}}.
\end{equation}
This is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fp-mich-response} for arm length \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}, mirror mass \SI{40}{\kilo\gram}, laser wavelength \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} and cavity half-bandwidth \SI{200}{\hertz}. The units of magnitude are photons \SI{}{\per\sqrthz} strain.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/40-fp-mich-response.pdf}
  \caption[Response of a \FPMI{} to differential arm cavity motion]{\label{fig:fp-mich-response}Response of a \FPMI{} to differential arm cavity motion.}
\end{figure}

The term $\mathbb{T}$ can be further broken down:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{T} = \text{e}^{2 \text{i} \beta_{\text{FP}} \left( f \right)}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    -\kappa_{\text{MI}} & 1
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
and so the optomechanical coupling factor transforms the input $\vec{a}$ in the sine quadrature by the mirror dynamics on its way to the output. The spectral density at the output port, $S \left( f \right)$, can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  S \left( f \right) = \left< \vec{b} \cdot \vec{b}^{\dag} \right>,
\end{equation}
and since the signal $h$ in the case of quantum noise is \num{0} we can define the output quantum noise $N \left( f \right)$:
\begin{equation}
  N \left( f \right) =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    -\kappa_{\text{MI}} & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a_c \\
    a_s
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -\kappa_{\text{MI}} \\
    0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Sensitivity of a \FPMI{}}
From the above definitions we can calculate the noise spectral density due to vacuum fluctuations at the output. Normal, unsqueezed vacuum has equal noise contributions in the cosine and sine quadratures, and so we can set it to the identity matrix:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:unsqueezed-vacuum-amplitude}
  \vec{a}_{\text{vacuum}} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The quantum noise power spectral density is then:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    N \left( f \right) &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      -\kappa_{\text{MI}} & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & -\kappa_{\text{MI}} \\
      0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & -\kappa_{\text{MI}} \\
      -\kappa_{\text{MI}} & 1 + \kappa^2_{\text{MI}}
    \end{pmatrix},
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and the signal read by the \gls{DC} readout is then:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    N_O \left( f \right) &= \vec{H}^{T} N \left( f \right) \vec{H}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

For \gls{DC} readout, the output noise spectral density is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fp-mich-noise}. This is the combination of radiation pressure noise from the mirrors and shot noise on the sensor, and these two effects combine to produce the quantum noise spectral density. At high frequencies, the quantum noise is equal to the quantum vacuum noise input from Equation\,\ref{eq:unsqueezed-vacuum-amplitude} (corresponding to $\kappa_{\text{MI}} \approx 0$) which shows that the signal on the sensor is limited by noise propagating to the output with no significant optomechanical interaction. Below the cavity pole, the vacuum fluctuations \checkme{move the mirror by an amount governed by the mirror's optomechanical coupling and so convert coherent cavity light into radiation pressure noise.}

  \caption[Quantum noise of a \FPMI{} at the output port]{\label{fig:fp-mich-noise}Quantum noise of a \FPMI{} at the output port.}
\end{figure}

The spectral density of the interferometer's sensitivity to differential arm cavity motion, $S_{\text{QNLS}}$, is given by the ratio of the quantum noise amplitude spectral density at the sensor to the response of the interferometer to that sensor for differential arm cavity motion, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{QNLS}} = \frac{N_O}{O_{\text{dc}}} h_{\left( - \right)};
\end{equation}
this is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fp-mich-sensitivity}.

  \caption[Sensitivity of a \FPMI{} at the output port to differential arm cavity motion]{\label{fig:fp-mich-sensitivity}Quantum noise limited sensitivity of a \FPMI{} at the output port to differential arm cavity motion. This is calculated by taking the quantum noise at the probe shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fp-mich-noise} and dividing it by the response from differential arm cavity motion to the probe shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:fp-mich-response}. In this case the cavity power was chosen to touch the \gls{SQL} at the cavity pole and this is shown in the figure. For smaller cavity power, the touching frequency moves down.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{sec:speed-meter-measurement}Sensitivity of a \SM{}}
Since the early 1990s it has been known that the measurement of momentum, known to be a quantum non-demolition (\gls{QND}) observable, offers the ability to surpass the \gls{SQL} in interferometric measurement \cite{Braginsky1990}. The force applied to test masses by a scheme involving the measurement of momentum does not affect its future value and so momentum can in principle be measured to arbitrary precision. Velocity is an appropriate observable to measure momentum and also approximates a \gls{QND} scheme due to its relation to momentum\footnote{Strictly, velocity is a \gls{QND} observable if the measurement is being made of a free mass \cite{Danilishin2012}. Since the test masses in a suspended interferometer are not free, this is only approximately correct in the frequency band far away from the suspension poles.}. Interferometers that measure velocity are called \emph{\SM{}s}. The principle of operation is as follows. The light from a laser enters the interferometer as it would for a position-meter, and accumulates a phase shift proportional to the propagation and the signal from any gravitational waves or disturbances in the positions of the mirrors. As the light reflects from the test masses within the interferometer it imparts radiation pressure from its light power and the quantum vacuum fluctuations as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:position-meter-measurement}. Somewhere within the interferometer there must be mechanisms to impart a phase shift equivalent to \SI{180}{\degree} upon the light, and for it to then interact with the same test masses as it did before. Upon propagating through the interferometer a second time, the effect of the radiation pressure from the first pass is suppressed by the opposite sign of the radiation pressure from the second pass. This process is repeated many times due to the finesse of the cavities within the interferometer, though some light escapes to the output where it can be sensed. The cancellation of radiation pressure induced noise in a \SM{} type interferometer is a key benefit for gravitational wave detection.

The \SSM{} topology is being considered as an alternative to the proposed \MI{}s in the \ET{} \cite{MuellerEbhardt2009a, Voronchev2015}, though it represents only one of many different speed-meter topologies \cite{Danilishin2004, Wang2013, Huttner2016, Wade2012}. We consider here two of the most well known types to highlight the significantly different forms in which a \SM{} interferometer can take.

\subsubsection{The Michelson-type \SM{}}
Initial suggestions for the design of \SM{} type interferometers were focused on Michelson-like topologies, for instance with the addition of a \emph{sloshing cavity} \cite{Braginsky2000, Purdue2002} at the output port of a standard \FPMI{}, as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:sloshing-michelson}. Here, the phase shift is imparted to the light by the addition of a beam splitter and cavity at the output of the interferometer. The light returning from the additional cavity is either re-injected into the interferometer or transmits through the beam splitter where it reflects from a signal recycling mirror. The light at the output of this interferometer then contains reduced quantum radiation pressure noise.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-svg/40-sloshing-michelson.pdf}
  \caption[Layout of a \MI{} with a sloshing cavity]{\label{fig:sloshing-michelson}Layout of a \MI{} with a sloshing cavity as presented in \cite{Purdue2002}. The light leaving the standard \MI{} is coupled into a sloshing cavity via a beam splitter where it receives a phase shift, and it re-enters the interferometer via the recycling mirror to the left of the sloshing beam splitter. The light incident upon the beam splitter then contains light that has sampled the mirrors at two points in time, leading to a \SM{} effect.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Sagnac-type \SM{}}
It was later realised by Chen that the \emph{zero-area Sagnac} is a \SM{} \cite{Chen2003}. This topology is arranged such that incident photons enter into two counter-propagating modes which sample the position of the test masses at different intervals. The Sagnac interferometer was originally developed to measure the rotation of the Earth. To avoid this, the propagation of the light is arranged in this zero-area configuration to cancel this effect. Instead, the interferometer's output contains information of the difference in round-trip phase of the two counter-propagating modes. Given two test masses $A$ and $B$, over a time interval of $\Delta t$ each mode $A$ and $B$ will measure phase change arising from motion of the arms smaller than the light propagation time \cite{Chen2003}:
\begin{align}
  \delta \phi_{A} &\propto \Delta x_{A} \left( t \right) + \Delta x_{B} \left( t + \Delta t \right) \\
  \delta \phi_{B} &\propto \Delta x_{B} \left( t \right) + \Delta x_{A} \left( t + \Delta t \right),
\end{align}
where $\Delta x_{A}$ and $\Delta x_{B}$ are the differences in position of test masses $A$ and $B$, respectively. At the output port, the combined signal will then be:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \delta \phi_{A} - \delta \phi_{B} &\propto \left( \Delta x_{A} \left( t \right) - \Delta x_{A} \left( t + \Delta t \right) \right) - \left( \Delta x_{B} \left( t \right) - \Delta x_{B} \left( t + \Delta t \right) \right) \\
                                      &\propto \Delta \dot{x}_{A} \left( t \right) - \Delta \dot{x}_{B} \left( t \right),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
which shows that the signal is proportional to the relative velocity of the test masses. The output port is automatically at the dark fringe for the carrier light as long as the motion of the test masses is slower than the light propagation time. The output is not dark for the signal sidebands, and as they contain components from the test masses sampled at different times the signal is proportional to test mass speed.

The layout of a \SSM{} interferometer can be arranged in different forms, and we show one based on a zero-area Sagnac enhanced with ring cavities as arms in Figure\,\ref{fig:zero-area-ssm}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-svg/40-zero-area-ssm.pdf}
  \caption[Layout of a zero-area \SSM{}]{\label{fig:zero-area-ssm}Layout of a zero-area \SSM{}.}
\end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Input-output relations}
The same approach to that for a \FPMI{} in Section\,\ref{sec:position-meter-measurement} can be taken to calculate the response and noise of a \SM{}, but with a value of $\kappa$ modified for a speed-meter \cite{Chen2003}:
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_{\text{SSM}} = 4 \kappa_{\text{MI}} \sin^2 \beta_{\text{FP}}.
\end{equation}
and as the round-trip phase includes both arms and an extra reflection from or transmission through the beam splitter, it is also modified:
\begin{equation}
  \beta_{\text{SSM}} = 2 \beta_{\text{FP}} + \frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{equation}

The response of a \SSM{} to differential arm cavity motion is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-response}. Notice that below the cavity pole, the response vanishes towards \gls{DC}, consistent with a speed measurement. The higher response above the cavity pole is a consequence of the fact that the light samples the interferometer in both directions. For fair comparisons to the \MI{} the choice may be made to half the input power or change the readout angle.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/40-ssm-response.pdf}
  \caption[Response of a \SSM{} to differential arm cavity motion]{\label{fig:ssm-response}Response of a \SSM{} to differential arm cavity motion.}
\end{figure}

The quantum noise at the output port is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-noise}. Note that the noise is unity at high frequencies as with the \FPMI{}, but is suppressed at low frequencies due to the cancellation of back-action due to radiation pressure from quantum vacuum fluctuations.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/40-ssm-noise.pdf}
  \caption[Quantum noise of a \SSM{} at the output port]{\label{fig:ssm-noise}Quantum noise of a \SSM{} at the output port.}
\end{figure}

While the response in a \SSM{} is reduced at low frequencies, the quantum noise is further reduced. Overall, the quantum noise limited sensitivity is improved in a \SSM{} over an equivalent \FPMI{} in the absence of loss, as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-sensitivity}.

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-python/40-ssm-sensitivity.pdf}
  \caption[Sensitivity of a \SSM{} at the output port to differential arm cavity motion]{\label{fig:ssm-sensitivity}Quantum noise limited sensitivity of a \SSM{} at the output port to differential arm cavity motion.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Loss in \SSM{}s}
The \gls{QND} behaviour of the interferometer arises from the fact that the output port contains only commutative time-dependent momentum information. Time-independent position information can, however, enter the output port of the interferometer in the presence of certain types of loss \cite{Danilishin2004}. For \emph{symmetric} loss, such as from imperfect transmissivity of the \glspl{ETM} or balanced substrate absorption in the \glspl{ITM}, a \emph{Michelson-like} sensitivity is introduced at a frequency proportional to the loss. Later it was shown that \emph{asymmetric} loss results in a greater decrease in sensitivity \cite{Danilishin2015}, with effects from imperfect beam splitting and imbalanced \gls{ITM} reflectivity considered.

The degradation in the sensitivity of a \SSM{} due to loss arises from the entry of vacuum fluctuations through the open ports created by loss mechanisms and from factors which result in imperfect cancellation of quantum radiation pressure effects. The optic most susceptible to asymmetries is typically the beam splitter, where coatings cannot be manufactured with better than around \SI{0.1}{\percent} tolerance\footnote{It turns out that the \SSM{} offers an excellent means of measuring a beam splitter's asymmetry.}. Imperfect splitting leads to different power in the counter-propagating modes which leads to optomechanical effects. In the \SSM{} this leads to light that would otherwise have exited at the input port of the interferometer instead exiting at the output port, carrying time-independent signal and therefore damaging the sensitivity. A similar effect arises from imbalances in the transmissivity of optics. This appears on sensitivity curves as an additional $\frac{1}{f}$ slope at low frequencies, like the position-meter behaviour shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-sensitivity}. The minimisation of loss is therefore critical in the design of a \SSM{} experiment.

\section{The Glasgow \SSMEXPT{}}
The Sagnac interferometer has been demonstrated in table-top experiments \cite{Shaddock1998} as well as lab-scale prototypes \cite{Beyersdorf2002} including the \gls{QND} behaviour of the \SSM{} \cite{Eberle2010} but so far this has not been demonstrated in a suspended prototype in the audio band to demonstrate its applicability for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Here we present a proof-of-principle experiment in Glasgow to test audio-band reduction of quantum radiation pressure noise in a suspended \SSM{} over an equivalent Michelson design \cite{Graef2014}. The \SSM{} is enhanced with the presence of triangular ring cavities to enhance the sensitivity of the interferometer to differential motion of the arms, and balanced homodyne readout will be utilised to sense the quantum correlations present at the otherwise dark output.

The intended optical layout is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:ssm-layout}. The light is coupled by the main beam splitter \MSIX{} into counter-propagating modes in the \emph{inner Sagnac}, i.e. the cavity formed by the mirrors \MSIX{}, \MSEVEN{}, \MONEA{}, \MTEN{}, \MNINE{}, \MEIGHT{} and \MONEB{}. At \glspl{ITM} \MONEA{} and \MONEB{} the light is partially transmitted into arm cavities $A$ and $B$, respectively, where the light is resonantly enhanced by the highly reflective \glspl{ETM} \MTWOA{} and \MTHREEA{} and \MTWOB{} and \MTHREEB{}. Upon exiting the cavities, the light again propagates through the inner Sagnac where it recombines at \MSIX{}. The light leaving \MSIX{} towards \MFOURTEEN{} contains the signal encoded as quantum correlations on the light, and this is enhanced at \MSIXTEEN{} by the local oscillator provided by the light leaving \MSIX{} towards \MTWELVE{}. The balanced homodyne detectors (\gls{BHD}) \HDA{} and \HDB{} measure the transmitted light, and the difference signal primarily contains information regarding the relative velocity of the arm cavities.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/generated/from-svg/40-speedmeter-layout.pdf}
  \caption[\SSMEXPT{} layout]{\label{fig:ssm-layout}\SSMEXPT{} layout.}
\end{figure}

The interferometer is to be situated within an ultra-high vacuum system formed from two adjoined cylindrical tanks with pumps capable of reaching pressures of \SI{1e-6}{\milli\bar}. Each tank contains a breadboard for the attachment of components, and this breadboard is itself isolated from ground motion by a series of passive damping stacks. The breadboards are rigidly connected via a bridge structure to ensure that residual platform motion is common to all suspended optics. The optics will be suspended from pendulum systems, with the most important test masses suspended from multiple stages to provide additional isolation from seismic noise. The parameters for the optics, laser injection, suspension systems and materials can be found in \cite{Graef2014}, \cite{Danilishin2015} and \cite{Leavey2016} in chronological order.

\subsection{\label{sec:bhd-intro}Balanced homodyne detection}
\note{Explain homodyne angle, basic description.}
The readout mechanism for the gravitational wave channel, the differential arm cavity degree of freedom, will be balanced homodyne readout. This choice contrasts to the \emph{de-facto} standard in gravitational wave observatories, \gls{DC} readout, because it is necessary for the measurement of sensitivity below the \gls{SQL} in the presence of imprecisely known loss to be able to alter the homodyne angle of the readout. In \gls{DC} readout, the homodyne angle is fixed by the propagation length between the detuned arm cavities and the output port. Balanced homodyne readout can choose arbitrary homodyne angles through the tuning of the relative phase of the (separate) local oscillator and signal paths.

Balanced homodyne readout involves making a subtraction of two signals measured in this case by \HDA{} and \HDB{}, observing light combined from a local oscillator, $a$, and the signal output of the \SSM{}, $b$. The local oscillator field should not contain signal, and so this will be taken from the light reflected from the interferometer back towards the input, via \MTWELVE{} and \MTHIRTEEN{}. The signal power measured at each photodetector output $c$ and $d$ then contains \cite{Steinlechner2015}:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    c^{\dag} c &= \frac{1}{2} \left( a^{\dag} a + a^{\dag} b \text{e}^{-\text{i} \phi} + a b^{\dag} \text{e}^{\text{i} \phi} + b^{\dag} b \right) \\
    d^{\dag} d &= \frac{1}{2} \left( a^{\dag} a + a^{\dag} b \text{e}^{\text{i} \phi} + a b^{\dag} \text{e}^{-\text{i} \phi} + b^{\dag} b \right),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the homodyne angle. The mixing of the two signals at \MSIXTEEN{} results in the \gls{DC} part of one field beating with the \gls{AC} part of the other field, and so a delicate subtraction of the two photocurrents from \HDA{} and \HDB{}, $I_{\text{BHD}}$, results in only the \gls{AC} parts corresponding to the motion of the test masses amplified by the local oscillator field:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    I_{\text{BHD}} &= c^{\dag} c - d^{\dag} d \\
                   &= a^{\dag} b \text{e}^{-\text{i} \phi} + a b^{\dag} \text{e}^{\text{i} \phi}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Laser noise and residual carrier light in the signal path can result in vastly increased noise in this readout scheme and so it is important for the relative intensity noise of the laser to be controlled to a high level and for the use of a beam splitter with balanced reflectivity and transmissivity \cite{Steinlechner2015}.

\subsection{Sensitivity}
Without including the effect of asymmetric loss, the quantum noise limited sensitivity of the \SSMEXPT{} calculated with both Finesse and Optickle (see Appendices \ref{sec:finesse-sim} and \ref{sec:optickle-sim}) is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:erc-ssm-qnls}. Also shown is an equivalent \MI{} using the same parameters and mirrors as the \SSM{}, but with input power scaled by a factor of approximately \num{2.5} to match the high frequency sensitivities. The homodyne angles of the \SSM{} and \MI{} are \SI{45}{\degree} and \SI{90}{\degree}, respectively, fairly optimise both interferometers for high frequency sensitivity. The intended measurement band is between \SI{100}{\hertz} and \SI{700}{\hertz}, and so a reduction of a factor of around \num{3} to \num{5} is in theory possible as long as other sources of noise are sufficiently low. A full consideration of the noise budget is given in Chapter\,\ref{c:speedmeter-control}.

The shaded \checkme{blue} region shows the intended measurement band, where reduced quantum radiation pressure noise should be visible below the expected noise from the equivalent \MI{}.}

\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Avoidance of ground loops}

One of the main issues faced by experiments involving numerous interfaces between digital and analogue devices is the creation of ground loops. Effectively an antenna.

Auxiliary coil driver cards can be plugged in to this board, which then maps the signals to a DB50 connector which connects to the vacuum feedthrough. This routes four coil signals (five conductors including ground) per coil driver, for seven coil drivers, to one DB50 connector. This can then be connected to the vacuum system, where the auxiliary octopus cable (see Figure XXX) maps these signals to individual auxiliary suspensions.}
